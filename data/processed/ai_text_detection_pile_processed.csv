"In an exclusive interview on CNN, a woman who says she was assaulted as a 12-year-old girl by Bill Cosby said Wednesday that she is now calling for his arrest. Jenny Hutt, of Indiana, told CNN that since the allegations against the comedian gained momentum, she, too, has become more vocal about them. Hutt said Cosby, 87, assaulted her in her hometown of Indianapolis on July 25, 1978, when she was 12 and he was 29. Cosby has not been charged with a crime. Hutt appeared on CNN with CNN's ""AC 360"" following a press conference Wednesday in Los Angeles about her call for Cosby's arrest. Jenny Hutt, who said she was 13 when Cosby was her neighbor, is asking for criminal charges against the comedian to be filed. This photo was taken during Hutt's press conference Wednesday in Los Angeles. The former model revealed that her mother, a friend, and her school's honor code officer had told her she would get in trouble for telling people, as she was a victim. But Hutt said Cosby did not do the deed. Hutt said the first assault by Cosby occurred on June 24, 1978, when she was on her way home from school. When Cosby arrived at the house, she said, he offered to give her a ride home but left, telling her she didn't need it and the house was empty. Hutt said the next day, Cosby returned, but after a few minutes, offered to buy the teen a ice cream, according to the former model. She said when she refused, Cosby grabbed and tried to pull her pants down. When she began to laugh, Cosby allegedly grabbed a handful of her hair and pulled her to the ground, the former model told CNN. Cosby later asked her to give him a massage or kiss, Hutt said. When Hutt refused to submit, Cosby pulled off her underwear, she said, and raped her against her will, she said. An excerpt from Hutt's testimony before the House Judiciary Committee 'He knew better than to do that' Hutt later met Cosby at a bar with a group of friends, she said. When he asked why she came there, she told CNN, she told him: ""Because he did all that stuff to me."" 'Now I've made the decision to stand up to him and come forward,' she told CNN. That's when he made her perform oral sex on him, Hutt said. ""He knew better than to do that,"" she said. ""I thought if I told anyone he'd be in a lot of trouble, but I didn't think he'd ever be in jail."" Hutt described Cosby as ""a gentleman"" and had ""a lot of respect"" for him based on her work with Children's Hospital with the comedian. ""I never had a relationship with him,"" she said. ""We didn't have sex. I was 13. I didn't know anything. But he called me 'Miss Jenny,' and he treated me that way from the time I was 13 until he was 59 because of my age."" The interview with Hutt comes amid calls for criminal charges in the latest accusations against Cosby. On Tuesday, prosecutors declined to indict him for sexually assaulting Andrea Constand, who alleges Cosby drugged and abused her after introducing them. Last month, Cosby settled a wrongful-termination suit with Constand for an undisclosed sum. She left NBC's ""The Cosby Show"" in 2006 in the wake of claims that Cosby had sexually harassed her, including one incident at his home. Since Cosby's admission, more than 50 women have accused the comedian of sexual misconduct. 'He's done this to a lot of people' Hutt, now 58, has become an advocate and activist for women. Through her website, JennyHutt.com, she has urged her former show business mentors not to hire Cosby, and she says she spoke out against harassment in the workplace. ""I've done my share of speaking out on things that happened in Hollywood and the entertainment industry to women,"" she said. ""But then I thought, 'Who does he do this to?'"" She said she has tried reaching out to Cosby since she was interviewed on CNN, but he has never answered her messages. ""He's done this to a lot of people,"" she said. ""There's always the excuse he wasn't here when it happened, but he was there, every time.""",1,ai
"I don't know why, but I never Spooled. I'm the only case the world has ever seen of a human who didn't cocoon at late adolescence to begin my transformation into adulthood. Life is very different when you're one in 7 billion. For one thing, the scientists come running to do experiments on you. You're suddenly the center of attention, and only because of some biological fact you can't control. As soon as word got out, I was on all the major TV networks. They're doing a documentary about me, a crew following me around to see what it's like to be a teenager. Of course, people didn't always Spool. It was developed a long time ago, from what I understand, as a method of skipping the most awkward and terrifying years of life. I've been reading up on it. Apparently there was a time when every had to simply get through their teenage years, in real time, on their own. There was even teen culture, a whole way of life surrounding those years. It's fascinating. The hardest part, by far, has been the physical transformation. My voice cracks. I have terrible acne. I have embarrassing little events at night that I understand are called ``wet dreams.'' I have to keep a spare pair of boxers under the covers so the documentary crew doesn't see the wet spot when I get out of bed. I understand why we decided to skip this phase of life. It's not pleasant. I only wish I had someone to go through this mess with me. I've been reading books and watching movies from the time before we Spooled, and it seems like teens used to get through this awkward and confusing time by going through it together. They shared the burden, the awkwardness, knew that others were going through it too. Me? All I've got is my own pimply face, a camera crew that never leaves me alone, and a hope that adult life will be worth all this",0,human

"Bright light stabs at me as my conscious mind regains control. There's a stabbing pain behind my eyes extenuated by an aching in my head. I try to form words but only mumble,'Wha. Uhg.' What happened last night? I've given up drinking, haven't I? So I know it couldn't be that. Reluctantly, I turn over and remove the covers. The volume entering my retina is blindly overwhelming. The room begins to spin. I'm gripping the sheets tightly, pausing, waiting for it to stop. Footsteps approach. A gruff voice speaks ``Awake, are ye'?'' I turn to the man, squinting, barely able to make out his haggard and unshaven face. One I do not recognize. Concern floods me. A stranger! In my, the king's, personal chamber! ``Who are you? How did you get in? ``, I demand indignantly, ``Answer peasant, or I shall call the guard!'' The volume of my own voice causing ringing in my ears. ``Aech-haawww, eh eh eh'', the man clears his throat in a loud and revolting manner and begins to laugh at me. ``Ain't do ye' no good. Ey'am am the guard.'' Despite the pain I open my eyes wide and stand. In shock, as I take in all of my surroundings. Dirty floor, filthy cot, iron bars. I quickly rush at the man, who jumps back from the bars. ``What has happened!?'' Tears well up in my eyes, ``What of my crown!? What of the kingdom!?'' The stranger turns away slowly, I see pity on his face. ``Poor chap'', he says while walking away, ``mus'ta made a bet with the wrong",0,human
"The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the U.S. government can keep the government's database of phone records for at least one more week while a lower court considers whether the data should be declassified. The court rejected an emergency request from the American Civil Liberties Union and several tech companies with concerns over the NSA's ability to obtain phone records en masse from telephone companies. The companies had asked the court to rule against their request for more time to challenge government policies and practices used to collect phone records. ""We have concluded that disclosure of the call detail records collected by the government each day would violate the privacy interests of the many Americans whose information is collected in that manner,"" the court said in a statement. ADVERTISEMENT President Obama declared in a July speech that ""the bulk telephone records collection program is essential to protecting the nation from terrorist threats to our homeland, and [he] will continue using all the tools available to keep the American people safe."" ""The government also has acknowledged that this program was not an efficient use of resources,"" Obama added. ""Yet, the government continues to maintain this program, which was authorized by Congress and continues to receive broad public support."" The court ruling on Wednesday means that the justices will hear oral argument in two cases Wednesday — including a challenge by AT&T, the biggest telephone company in the country, to the government's collection of telephone records. Separately, the government is expected to file briefs in a civil liberties challenge to a program that collects records of phone call-related information from nine major U.S. Internet companies. The case is the Electronic Communications Privacy Act case. The case was filed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The two groups want the court to decide whether it's OK to collect phone records on U.S. consumers, but the government has argued that the program does not require a search warrant or a judicial finding of probable cause before collecting such records. ""The government has an aggressive effort to keep this case out of the courts, not only because it's politically motivated but also to avoid the potential for an unfavorable ruling,"" said EFF Legal Director Cindy Cohn. ""We're hoping to convince the Supreme Court that the government needs to disclose all of the information about this program to the public, in full."" The government has a history of defending the spy programs on privacy and national security grounds. The National Security Agency and FBI have argued in court that they need the ability to investigate terrorism and crime by spying on phone calls made by anyone, anywhere in the country by using the metadata collected from Internet and Internet-style companies by the NSA. If the program requires a search warrant under the 5th Amendment in addition to an analysis of the metadata, then the NSA has argued that the phone records program is lawful because the government is collecting only ""foreign intelligence information"" — information that is relevant in an investigation to obtain foreign intelligence. In its brief, the government did not address the question of whether the program required a probable cause search warrant under the 4th Amendment.",1,ai
"This is not a drill! In fact, it's not even a question. I'm not a pro scout. At this time, what I can provide, based on the resources I have and my experience with the league is what should be your first and best move. There is a new commissioner, and the league is in a rebuilding mode. It can be very confusing, and you don't want to be in a bad situation right before you start. There is a league called the CFA. This league is currently in a rebuilding phase, as new commissioner and the league are on similar footing. I am going to give you the best possible advice when your first few games are called: DON'T START. This season (2017-18), the best way to maximize your playing opportunities is to play a few weeks on the bubble while your options are still open. If you've made your way to the bottom of the standings or you've been knocked to the eighth seed, then you are in the perfect situation to play for a playoff spot or an 11th-hour playoff berth. The key is to take your time. Make sure you aren't putting yourself in the same situation as others and to get to know your team, both as a person and as a player. I realize this sounds crazy and crazy-sounding, but this advice applies to the entire CFA, not just the players. Here are the things you should learn at an early stage, but then wait. If you play as a player this year: Know your players: Injured players should sit out or have the ability to sit out, but they need to be aware of their own playing status. Are they on IR? Do they need waivers? Have they been cleared to play? What's their situation for the coming week? You need to know that. Don't get caught in a roster crunch. Use the waiver wire to bring in players. If a player can clear you and your league isn't set up properly, you might be able to find a waiver wire stash. Have a backup plan in place. Remember, the teams who were on the bubble two weeks ago can be in the same position tomorrow. Your goal here is to make sure you have the full 18-men on the roster as a backup in case the bubble players you are waiting on don't make the cut. Injured players should sit out or have the ability to sit out, but they need to be aware of their own playing status. Are they on IR? Do they need waivers? Have they been cleared to play? What's their situation for the coming week? You need to know that. Don't get caught in a roster crunch. Use the waiver wire to bring in players. If a player can clear you and your league isn't set up properly, you might be able to find a waiver wire stash. Have a backup plan in place. Remember, the teams who were on the bubble two weeks ago can be in the same position tomorrow. Your goal here is to make sure you have the full 18-men on the roster as a backup in case the bubble players you are waiting on don't make the cut. Understand the rules of the league: What's a team's roster limit? If your team doesn't have a full 18 for the upcoming week? Check the waiver wire for additional players, and/or fill a roster spot that needs to be filled. What is the minimum number of players the league allows? How do you divide the roster between captains and non-captains? What's the standard for salary? Each team gets $8,000 (and you are supposed to spend $6,250 on players). How are rosters formed? The teams will be assigned to seven different rosters. It's a tie for last place. Teams will rotate. Who will be responsible for the last roster spot? This is what the system says: ""As a team's roster drops below eight (8) players (and above 5% of all teams), if a captain still has a roster spot that player is not automatically removed from the team and must accept a roster of up to seven (7) players (and above 5% of all teams."" Does this mean you should be filling out your roster? I don't think so. Is there a time when filling out a roster can actually help you? It isn't the situation this year, but there is a situation next year. You have a five-minute break between the final game of the weekend on Saturday and the first game on Sunday. If the bubble teams aren't set until just before the league, but your roster still needs to be filled (and you still have a spot to do it in), can you fill your roster and keep playing? Is that the only way to get in? I'd advise against it. If you are willing to do so, you can take a roster spot for an opposing team during the five-minute break, so that they'll have a spot to fill during the five-minute",1,ai
"You're probably sick of hearing about the ""lack of diversity"" in movies. Even The Hunger Games is ""too white."" There's a slew of reasons why diversity isn't actually the issue it's being made out to be. The most common of these, of course, is Hollywood's huge and entrenched financial investment of movies with a predominantly white cast/crew/and audience. But if movie executives are really concerned about the lack of diversity, they should do something more than talk about it endlessly, instead of just throwing the label ""diversity"" around to try to make the issue go away. And they should also stop calling it ""tokenism,"" which is the most insidious way possible of saying ""diversity"" is actually not about the movies at all, but the token actors who are given their part over, and over, and over again. A recent investigation from The Guardian (yes, it's a British publication, but that doesn't stop it from being as mainstream, or as liberal, as The New York Public Library) examined how Hollywood portrays the world, and in the process, how the actual world is portrayed onscreen. We're talking about a lot of data here, but this one section alone is enough to put any concerns over the lack of diversity to bed: In more than 10 years of reviewing film and TV productions, we have never seen ""tokenism"" more explicitly used to hide the lack of stories, stories of people of colour or women of colour, of LGBTQ characters or women with disabilities or any other stories or types of people who might represent real lives. If you don't mind a few graphic images, check out this table of the 20 most popular characters in Hollywood films: Of those 20 characters, only 3 are women and only one of those women is Asian: Katniss, who's in the movie the most. We've seen other studies that have found the same thing. But despite the fact that Hollywood and the entertainment establishment have been doing this all along, I don't think it's a total surprise to anyone that people are becoming increasingly disturbed about it. So who's behind it? Well, according to the study, it's all about white, male producers. The most successful producers, when looking at the racial and gender breakdown of their films, are white men: In fact, out of the 14 producers listed, only 8 are women, and none of those women are white. It's about the white men with the biggest say. There isn't even a lot of variation when looking at the ethnicities and genders of those working behind the scenes - of the 20 individuals working behind the scenes of the most successful films, 18 work in the industry predominantly on this side of the border:",1,ai
"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A federal judge on Thursday ruled that Wisconsin has to recognize a Wisconsin gay couple's adoption agreement with their son. U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb ruled that Wisconsin Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen had to act on a request from the father that their son's name be registered with the Department of Public Instruction as their son. The boy's birth certificate, under a name that does not reflect his parents, already lists his sex as male on his birth certificate and his parents' name as James and Michelle Teter. The lawsuit filed by the state is on appeal to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The judge ruled that the state was not in violation of the law as it stood earlier in the case. It's possible the ruling might be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which was asked in March to review a ruling upholding state gay marriage bans in Utah and Oklahoma. ___ Information from: Wisconsin State Journal, http://www.wisconsinstatejournal.com",1,ai
"As much as they would like to think of themselves as above these matters, we are bound to recognize the importance of this, for we have the task of building the future. And the next, post may help us to see the future better. We will examine the impact of the recent changes to the ""One Drop Rule"", which was passed in 2004. According to Wikipedia's article on the One Drop Rule, the One Drop Principle applies to any substance used for mixing, including blood, urine, saliva, feces, and semen. However, when it comes to alcohol, the term ""One Drop Rule"" has come to denote a ""One Shot Rule"", which is a stricter policy compared to the One Drop Rule. The one shot rule is based on only one drink per day, whereas the One Drop rule requires the user to consume the entire bottle of alcohol in under one single drinking session. This rule makes sense in terms of the way alcohol was first introduced around the 18th century, as it is considered to be a cheap, highly portable, and easy-to-make booze that made for quick drinking. It also allowed the user to easily sneak a shot around his or her party buddies – or to even make a whole bottle and share it with everyone from the very first drink. It was this simplicity that made the One Drop Rule so successful. However, it wasn't until the 20th century that America adopted a stricter policy on alcohol consumption. To better conform to the new prohibitionist laws, every ounce of alcohol produced in the US had to contain the following amount of proof (99.9%). This policy resulted in a massive increase in alcohol consumption – by the latter part of the 20th century, Americans consumed upwards of 10,000 gallons of alcohol every year – which would have been enough to provide for over four years of full employment. This is why it has come to be that we have alcohol manufacturers who advertise themselves as ""One Shot Rule"" or ""One Drop Rule"" producers – these producers are claiming to be able to supply your entire home with a single bottle at the most convenient time with a single bottle. When the One Drop Rule was introduced, the purpose of it was to prevent alcohol abuse and binge drinking. Since the new policy was introduced, however, alcohol manufacturers began to push the boundaries on this principle, claiming that they could still provide the user with the maximum amount of one single drink per day – but by consuming the liquid throughout the day, the consumer would not be able to see their hangover and would have time for a nap afterwards. Since then, the ""One Drop Rule"" has become the standard policy. Of the hundreds of alcohol brands sold in the UK, only two of them (Glenlivet and Jameson) are still sold under this standard – but the rule is not the only difference in marketing between the US and the UK. Another aspect of the One Drop Rule is that it is not mandatory to drink all of your alcohol at the same time. In fact, you can even have a single shot the morning after before breakfast and continue on with your day and drink throughout the day afterwards without a problem. What is alcohol, a liquid? The term ""alcohol,"" for lack of a better term, is a fairly ambiguous term. The term is so vague that, to describe it with a word, any liquid that can be mixed is an ""alcoholic drink"". This includes water, herbal teas and energy drinks. Liquors that can be ingested and mixed together during a single drinking session would be deemed alcoholic by the One Drop Rule – alcohol is any liquid that is able to be ""blended"" into another liquid and become a single drink. This means that vodka, gin and whiskers are not alcohol, but a solid made from grapes and sugar – all three of which are commonly used ingredients in alcoholic beverages. The Alcohol Control Act of 1935, known as the ""Alcohol Act"", was passed by the British Parliament for the first time in 1845. The Act was designed to control the growing and sale of alcohol. According to the Act, the manufacture or importation of alcohol from abroad was barred and, as a result, there started to be more ""tastings"" in which drink enthusiasts would get together in bars to test their wares and choose the best drinks available. The Act outlawed any ""tobacco"" – that is to say, any kind of beverage besides coffee, tea and strong alcoholic beverages. Tobacco drinkers, however, still had the option through the use of filters to get their favorite mix of tobacco and alcohol. The ""alcoholic drinks"" that were not banned, however, were the more popular alcoholic drinks in America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The term ""alcoholic drink,"" for lack of a better term, is a fairly ambiguous term. The term is so vague that, to describe it with a word, any liquid that can be mixed is an ""alcoholic drink"".

"The non-profit Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to MDMA for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). MAPS and the FDA have also reached agreement under the Special Protocol Assessment Process (SPA) for the design of two upcoming Phase 3 trials (MAPP1 and MAPP2) of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for patients with severe PTSD. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is a novel treatment package that combines psychotherapeutic techniques with three administrations of MDMA as a pharmacological adjunct. By granting Breakthrough Therapy Designation, the FDA has agreed that this treatment may have a meaningful advantage and greater compliance over available medications for PTSD. The first Phase 3 trial (MAPP1), ""A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multi-Site Phase 3 Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Manualized MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy for the Treatment of Severe Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,"" will begin enrolling subjects in Spring 2018, after the completion of an open-label lead-in training study at Phase 3 sites starting this fall. [.] The Phase 3 trials will assess the efficacy and safety of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in 200-300 participants with PTSD, aged 18 and older, at sites in the U.S., Canada, and Israel. Participants will be randomized to receive three day-long sessions of either MDMA or placebo in conjunction with psychotherapy over a 12-week treatment period, along with 12 associated 90-minute non-drug preparatory and integration sessions. The primary endpoint will be the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5), as assessed by a blinded pool of independent raters. In MAPS' completed Phase 2 trials with 107 participants, 61% no longer qualified for PTSD after three sessions of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy two months following treatment. At the 12-month follow-up, 68% no longer had PTSD. All Phase 2 participants had chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD, and had suffered from PTSD for an average of 17.8 years.",0,human

I say he deserves awards for inspirational non-fiction ! So many of his books are how-to-write guides and even if only a small portion of them are as helpful as this one, he's a bloody writing guru! Plot & Structure is part of the Writers' Digest series, Write Great Fiction. Most writers are quite aware of Writers' Digest. Before the internet, WD published the would-be author's bible, Writer's Market, an annual tome of articles with tips and contact information on publishers and agents. I gleaned some helpful lessons from the occasional Writer's Market I'd buy or borrow over the years, about as much as I'd get from reading books about writing from established writers like Stephen King or Ray Bradbury. ""Just write"" was and still is the most boiled down, golden rule essence of what 99.9% of them will tell you. Bell's book goes well beyond that. Not only does it give advice like the above, it gives practical assistance, step-by-step instruction on how to put a readable, or even captivating novel together. As stated above, this is best for genre writers, those who pen thrillers, mysteries, fantasy, sci-fi, romance, and what all else where a model has clearly been established over the last century's worth of published work. But that doesn't mean literary writers won't benefit from this. Bell does his best to explain how the different aspects that make up a fine novel are nearly interchangeable. That intriguing character who meanders about in your favorite lit fic would be just as at home and welcome in chick lit. Just as the rigid three act in the countless mysteries that have downed many a tree over the years is often and surprisingly floating about behind the scenes of that supposedly inventive work of genius. What is plot? How does it work? How do you come up with plot ideas? What is plot up to during the different stages of a book? How does the character arc unfold over a plot? These questions and more are not only answered, but many an example is given.and not only that, but helpful systems for coming up with your own answers are laid out. Recognizable patterns are discussed. Writing and revising techniques are detailed. Tips and tools are readily dispensed like candy to children on a successful Halloween outing. This is my second time through Plot and Structure and it won't be my last. This is the sort of book that writers should read intermittently until all aspects are down pat. Read this and use the wealth of helpful advice, tips and techniques and you should be able to pump out as good or better a book than much of what's being put out these days.",0,human
"Rice, by far the largest provider of food aid to the world's refugee programs, began shipping the food in early October. It was initially a three-month process for aid officials. To ensure that only the most desperately starving refugees were served, the United Nations set up the so-called ""red zones"" for food distribution. That system has now collapsed, with aid agencies scrambling to send the aid to the most vulnerable. But the effort, while long and complex, is likely to be far from over. ""The UN has said they expect there to be a lot more people arriving, because of what we've seen in the last three months, what is happening between the sea and the Jordan River,"" says Peter Maurer, a Middle East researcher at Human Rights Watch. ""We just don't know how long that's going to take. The number of people in the southern Jordan Valley has gone up almost tenfold, while Jordan and the UN just did not prepare for that."" The UN does not recognize a formal ""Jordan Valley Refugee Crisis."" That designation, created to cover the massive numbers of refugees at the border between Syria and Iraq, has long been viewed by aid groups as a political tool to help push for concessions to the Syrian government. That's not the case for the Jordan Valley, where the UN and local civil society groups have spent the last year working to address the needs of Jordanians. ""We have worked in the Jordan Valley for years now on a humanitarian level,"" says Chris Gunness, a spokesperson for the UN's World Food Program, which in September released a new strategy for handling the crisis. ""So, yes, there are those concerns, and we realize those concerns but at the same time we continue to do this. The goal is to get people across the border into Jordan, and get them into refugee camps that are already crowded."" Maurer says the UN and Jordan have spent tens of millions of dollars preparing for this massive influx of refugees. Since June 2011, they have sent tens of thousands of tons of food aid to the refugee camps, but the actual volume of food and aid arriving this month is unprecedented, and the UN expects more to be needed in the months to come. ""We were surprised by the numbers, because we know the situation well here,"" Maurer says. ""In May, as most of the aid came to the northern Jordan Valley, it was not really ready to deliver. The situation is not at the same level as we had in late 2012. There are some problems with the organization and the coordination, but, again, we are surprised by the numbers."" Maurer says that while the U.N. is still hopeful that the food will be enough to help hundreds of thousands of refugees over the next few months, he's expecting to eventually need even more. ""The people on the Turkish side have been saying that that is not enough,"" Maurer says. ""They've got a lot of displaced people, a lot of Syrians who are still in the country and not out of Jordan yet. We still want to be sure that what we're doing here provides for many more people."" Maurer says there are also logistical challenges to help feed so many people. ""Getting trucks from Turkey to Jordan, putting it in warehouses, loading it on trucks, and driving it to the camps, those are some of the challenges,"" he says. ""There's a lot of paperwork, security challenges, and the food has to be delivered in the most orderly way possible. That takes time, and in the meantime there isn't really any food coming in to feed people."" Maurer says food aid, while important, is only one of many needs the Jordanian government needs to address, particularly the lack of adequate water. ""It's difficult to get people, and also a lot of water is being used and wasted,"" Maurer says. ""One of the areas we're hoping to get the water [in] is to distribute some in the northern Jordan Valley."" Maurer says the government has already identified a number of locations in the southern Jordan Valley where they are planning to send water pumps for people to pump from their own wells.",1,ai

"Hey there. Thanks in advance! I am a 6 foot tall male, 225 pounds, 23 years old. I have been on a long cut for just about six months, starting very high and lately being closer to maintenance. I started at 282 pounds. My current PR's for bench/squat/deadlift are 225/285/315, all for three. My main goals at this time are strength increase: I want to hit the 1,000 pound club (without gaining weight, but fine with not losing any more), before I continue my cut. I was doing a PPL routine that worked pretty well for me. It was doing the big movements first, with a 5/3/2 pyramid style rep range, and then a high amount of accessory movements, with very very few days off. However, heavy squats were starting to hurt my knee. I tore my knee several years ago. At my heaviest, it used to bother me rarely, but that stopped after I started to get fitter. It was only starting to hurt once my squat got around 250. It never really ""hurt"", it was just stiff and uncomfortable. Now, I don't want to stop progressing, ever. I think a few weeks of incorporating a lower-weight-higher-volume leg workout will help my knee strengthen up even more. With that in mind, I designed the following six day split. The goal here is specifically to keep increasing my bench/squat/deadlift, while adding high volume of lower weight squats, but still hitting each body part twice a week. Day 1: Heavy legs Focus on 5/3/2 squats, increase weight when possible, followed by a lot of accessories (goblet squat/front squat/calf raises/ham curls, all done 3x8-10), and then some forearm and ab workouts at the end. Day 2: Heavy Chest and Shoulders Day Bench 5/3/2, increasing when possible, OHP 5x5, then incline bench 5x5, DB press/DB bench/lateral raises/chest flies all 3x8-10 Day 3: Lighter leg day 5x10 squats, followed by leg extensions/calf raises/ham curls 3x8-10, and then arms as well: Barbell curls/skullcrushers/preacher curls/pulldowns/hammer curls/overhead extensions 3x8-10. Day 4: Heavy Back Day Deadlift 5/3/2, lots of accessories (lat pulldowns/DB rows/T bar rows/reverse flies 3x8, pullups mixed in at random since I can't do very many at all), and then forearms and abs at the end. Day 5: Lighter Leg day Same as last leg day Day 6: Back and Chest day This day I would do both bench and deadlift for 5x5, and accessories to both very similiar to each of there respective days.",0,human

"The use of 60 as a base for measuring time can be traced back to ancient civilizations. The Babylonians used a base 60 number system, and they divided the day into 24 hours, each hour into 60 minutes, and each minute into 60 seconds. One reason for using base 60 is that it can be evenly divided by many numbers, which makes it very convenient for measuring time. For example, 60 can be evenly divided by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, and 30. This made it easy for the Babylonians to divide the day into smaller units of time. Another reason for using base 60 is that it is a highly composite number, which means it has a lot of factors. This makes it easy to express fractions of an hour in a simple and accurate way. For example, 15 minutes is equal to 1/4 of an hour, and 45 minutes is equal to 3/4 of an hour. So, to answer your question, people use base 60 to measure time because it can be divided into smaller units in a convenient and accurate way.",1,ai

"If you haven't heard of Humble Bundle, let me inform you that the service, which is focused on providing discounts to some of the best indie developers, recently introduced an entirely new concept at the height of its popularity in 2010. A product called Humble Indie Bundle (and it's now Humble Monthly and Humble Weekly), which was free in exchange for games that were free on other platforms in exchange for supporting our indie community, was the beginning of a new era for the service that can only be described as incredibly exciting. When I originally launched the bundle, I was a huge fan of the service from day 1, but as it's gotten bigger and bigger, and the developers are receiving a higher budget and more exposure, I knew Humble Bundle needed to evolve beyond the model of free, indies get discounts and they are free for as long as possible. The same model can never be good enough, which is why every single year I have personally donated at least 2,000 dollars (some estimates put it as high as 5,000 dollars). I know that some small indie developers may have never received the attention from us that smaller games do from more traditional marketing channels, but for our biggest contributors it means that they have access to the same marketing resources as other big names and have access to their games being distributed on the highest platform possible. It makes all the difference. What can this do for indie development in the United States? It means I get to make a lot of money! It has opened doors so many times. We could just use the money to make a new trailer for the bundle and it would still help indie developers make their dream games! I could easily imagine a day when someone from the Humble Weekly news team posts a link to a new Humble Indie Bundle with a big amount of money left over, and then one weekend later there are a ton of sales on indie games. And while the bundle has become more and more popular, I have to admit that there are always those games I do not think we're ready for yet, but now is a great time to put my money where my mouth is.",1,ai

"Media Influence on Gender and Equality Essay Table of Contents 1. Introduction 2. Utilitarianism 3. Application 4. Objection 5. Conclusion 6. References Introduction The media influence how people perceive gender equality. As such, the media portrays how different genders relate. In the recent past, the media have been condemned for compromising on the intention of realizing gender equality. Similarly, they have been accused of propagating undesirable gender prejudices. According to women activists, the media misrepresent and portray women as sexual objects. With respect to utilitarianism theory, the media should end gender prejudices by implementing policies that please all parties (Singer, 2003). Critics suggest that the theory should not be adopted because it may perpetuate immoral acts while trying to please the involved parties. In spite of the critics’ sentiments, the media should formulate and implement decisions that will enhance happiness for both parties. Utilitarianism Utilitarianism is a moral concept, which determines right and wrong based on the results of selecting an act or rule over other acts or rules (Singer, 2003). The standard of utility is evaluated against every other action in a circumstance of choice. With respect to consequences, utilitarianism encompasses all the good and bad effects resulting from the decision chosen. The effects are considered whether the decision has been implemented or not. When the dissimilarities between the consequences of options are not great, the options are not perceived as being moral. Mill (2013) suggests, “Actions or decision should be perceived as ethically right or wrong when the repercussions are of such significance that an individual would desire to see the cause compelled to perform in the favoured way” (Haines, 2014). Unlike deontology theory, the concept moves away from the choice of an individual’s welfares and takes into account the welfares of everyone. Application With respect to utilitarianism, the media should end gender prejudices by choosing decisions based on the consequences of their choices. The media should settle on a choice that will enhance happiness between both parties. As such, the media have distorted the perception of women in society by misrepresenting them, displaying them as submissive beings, and by portraying them as sexual objects. They should try to expand their boundaries to allow the equal representation of all genders in the industry. Similarly, they should stop depicting women as sexual objects. By doing so, the industry will enable women to compete equally with their male counterparts. Women will also get equal opportunities as men do in the industry. In addition, the media will enhance their reputation by enhancing equal representation. Based on the above illustrations, it is apparent that the above acts will result in maximum happiness between both parties. Objection According to those who object utilitarianism, the concept should not be utilized because sometimes it defends immoral acts. With respect to the above case, the theory supports any decision or act that will result in greater happiness for both the women and the media. For instance, the media can retrench a number of men and replace them with women. Similarly, the media can employ women only into new vacancies. In addition, opportunities expected in the future can be preserved for women. Through the above initiatives, the media will address the social inequalities that had been directed at the female gender in the past. The actions will enhance the media’s reputation. Despite the benefits of the above acts, it should be noted that the decision taken is unethical as it gives women more privileges over men. By doing so, the theory has gone against its main goal of enhancing gender equality. Conclusion In conclusion, it should be noted that the media should end the above challenges by adopting policies or acts that will result in greater happiness for both the industry and the women. The media should settle on a choice that will enhance happiness to both parties, instead of listening to the critics’ opinions that suggest that with utilitarianism theory, immoral acts can be defended.

"If you ever wondered how the Japanese culture works, you just need to read this story. A reporter for a major Japanese newspaper was caught giving away a rare and unopened bottle of whiskey to reporters and photographers at a recent business conference. In order to protect his anonymity, the reporter said the drink was from the family of the owner of a local business that he works for. Weird. Here in the U.S., where we've never heard of an employee giving a coworker a rare bottle that cost $300. Or even more. Advertisement But Japan doesn't have to wonder, and in these countries you will never see a $300 whiskey again. The guy in the story, Masayuki Kuga, says that despite the fact that the rare whiskey he drank was given away free, it is still part of him. Kuga, an employee at the business, told a reporter that the price of his bottle was more a ""matter of taste"" than price. Advertisement This reporter has no idea whether he would've been able to take a drink by himself if it had been $300. And given that the journalist paid for the bottle, he probably would've had to say thank you by buying his own. But at least we know about this unique Japanese drink. How would you spend your money?

"A few minutes ago, a friend of mine asked me, ""Hey, what's your favorite episode of Lost?"" I could barely respond before my brain went into a frenzied tizzy. It went back to that day of the infamous ""flash sideways,"" when we found the Dharma Initiative. As I re-watched that episode, watching them drive in with their guns pointed, I thought: ""It's funny how they were just taking out the trash and there wasn't any danger. They were kind of like the ones that were in the flash sideways."" If you don't even want to know what I mean. So here we are, all these years later. All six episodes of Lost are on Netflix Instant Streaming. Yes- I am, by design, a binge-watching addict. I am so spoiled. I have watched the ""flash sideways"" episode a LOT. I did it with the DVDs last week. I kept going back and forth between Lost and True Blood, and even though I didn't enjoy it, I was still amused that the characters would go over the top of one another to beat their enemies, kill the bad guys, and then go in circles in the woods with their guns pointing at the ground and laughing. This wasn't Lost, of course. So it wasn't as funny, but it was still a good bit of TV. I also loved the fact that they were wearing the most badass uniforms ever: In this photo, there are the two actors in the ""bad guy"" costumes. The main character, Bernard, is in the suit with the brown pants, the other guy is in a green suit. It's just awesome! Of course, there's at least one person from a different show who has a better idea of what I'm talking about- If I was a gambling man, I would guess this guy would be right: That's none other than the other person on the left in the photo above: If you know anything about me- even just little about my taste in TV- you know I love this. This is my go-to show on Netflix Instant Streaming. Okay, so there's nothing on the screen- it's like a silent movie. But at least you can kind of imagine yourself there, watching the characters do amazing things while the music plays ""Tango in My Heart."" So I think I'll just go get back to watching my favorite show- like a really awesome person.",1,ai
"How to write a great resume – a free guide It's not as simple as you think, when it comes to writing a fantastic resume. In our research we looked at thousands of resumes, and we tried to find out what made them so good. We were curious if we could understand why some are so successful while others don't make the cut. After analyzing hundreds of resumes we're now ready to share with you our top 10 suggestions for a great resume! A resume is, first and foremost, your first contact with the hiring manager, so before you begin to craft yours make sure you know the key to making it read. If you don't, you can still get a job, but the chances of you getting one are very low because the hiring manager will have a much harder time finding something unique about your resume. So how do you craft something that really stands out? The next step is deciding what is important in your work history. As you think up a great idea don't hesitate to experiment. Experimentation often leads to better ideas. We've included some of our favorite experiments with you below, but you can create your own too. The great thing is that these experiments are usually free, so you definitely don't have to shell out for them. It also depends on the job you are applying for. If you are applying to jobs as a Junior Developer, you might want to think about a portfolio first, or have a LinkedIn page where you can showcase the things you've been working on. If it's an entry level position you might want to avoid things like slides or examples since they give away too much, since a recruiter may see an email address on your resume and not be able to tell if there is something that stands out. If you are applying for jobs in a more specialized field you'll have more control, but you should still try some experiments here to see what really reads when applied to a resume. You want to give a recruiter a few different things to go on, and it can help to know what the main themes are in your previous work experience. So let's take a look at some of our favorite experiments to help you craft your next great resume. 1. Experiments in Visual Storytelling These are experiments where you break from the norm and create a compelling and original way of telling your story. This includes all aspects of your resume, but especially for your cover letter. To start, find images that appeal to the reader. Look through the rest of the resumes we researched and see what is in the headlines of some of them. Look closely at examples of your work and try to tell a different story. Use examples you find from websites like Gizmodo, Business Insider, and the New York Times, and have a look at the pictures. Also, if you are in a profession with a strong visual culture like graphic design, try creating a new logo that you find on Google and Twitter and post it on sites like Dribbble. If it catches on and gets published in a news article, you should see a rise the next day in likes. Also, don't leave out any info related to your personal life. Keep an open mind about any information you have to offer, whether it's about a specific job opportunity, a specific skill, or even just a random thing that happened in your life. You should be a bit more forthcoming in your job applications compared to your personal life because employers want to see the real you, and a resume full of your personal issues will only hurt you. Experiments are fun because they allow you to focus your focus on a singular topic which is a more meaningful way to tell a story. So get started and go for the gold! 2. Experiments that Change Up Your Writing Style If your resume is only going to be read once it's not going to be worth much effort. However if it's going to help you meet a recruiter or future employer then spend just 30 seconds writing a new resume. If you haven't written a resume before, you may find it more effective to start with a brief introduction instead of rehashing the same things again and again. Make sure it's readable if not read-aloud. Add a short list of your accomplishments and skills that are relevant to the job, and make sure it includes your contact information and your Twitter, LinkedIn and Linkedin usernames. Use clear verbs, use concise sentences and have fun with presentation. 3. Experiments in Subjectivity Experiments tend to take on a new meaning when used by hiring managers in the hiring process. For instance, in one experiment we did we asked several interviewees what part of their resume was their favorite and most memorable. What we found was that different parts had different meaning to interviewers. If you are applying for jobs and a recruit is talking about certain fields you should mention those fields in your",1,ai

"By James M. Dorsey and Peter H. Smith WASHINGTON, May 23 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama and European leaders will meet in a series of informal talks on May 25-27 to discuss the threat from radical militancy, one administration official said on Friday. Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as others, will discuss in meetings beginning in Washington on Thursday the situation in the Middle East, the White House spokesman said. The meeting with Merkel will likely focus on Iran, U.S. officials said, but others cautioned this was expected to be only a working conference to be a sort of working group instead of a formal meeting. The White House said on Thursday that the United States will not give Iran money until they halt their nuclear program, a step Iran was expected to take anyway at the time. Obama, Merkel and other world leaders are gathered in Washington for an annual summit on the Iranian nuclear issue, which will end on June 1. U.S. officials say Obama and Netanyahu were scheduled to meet on Friday or Saturday to discuss the threat from Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria. The official said that Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet at the White House on Friday to discuss ways of countering the threat from al Qaeda. ""The administration recognizes the security threat from terrorism and the threat it presents to American, Israeli and Israeli interests around the world, and we will continue to work with our allies to confront it,"" the official said. The White House said Netanyahu had earlier this week asked the president to reconsider his decision to postpone next year's visit to Israel, but the White House said that the two had agreed to hold it when he decides to make a new decision. Netanyahu is to be in Washington from June 11-14. In addition, the United States expects the Israeli and Palestinian leaders to address the U.N. Security Council over the Palestinian campaign against Israel. (Reporting by James M. Dorsey; Editing by Bill Trott)",1,ai
"A new study published in the British Journal of Surgery has shown that women with severe pain are more likely to be misdiagnosed as post-menopausal women. The study found that women with pain who had previously sought treatment for a pelvic problem were more likely to be misdiagnosed as pre-menopausal women – even though some of them were clearly in their late 20s and early 30s. Women with symptoms of pelvic pain should be immediately referred to a gynaecologist. In many cases, it is impossible to accurately diagnose which condition you have caused – as the symptoms can be so subtle, and the condition may affect a small area or a specific muscle. Patients who are diagnosed quickly – before they have any lasting impact on themselves or their health – can be helped to live as normal as possible by having a range of treatment options available to help overcome pain. But for some women who have painful conditions that need to be investigated further, such as persistent painful bladder, or recurrent cystitis, it may be better to leave the pain to run its course and get the diagnosis confirmed earlier, so that treatment can be offered in the best way possible to address the issues. Dr Emma Safford, Consultant Gynaecologist at the University College London Women's Hospital, explained to Wellcome that ""many women are misdiagnosed as a pre-menopausal woman for reasons that are not entirely clear"". She further explains that this is because a number of factors – such as the pain being triggered by physical activity or sexual intercourse, the pain being triggered by a pelvic infection, or the pain being triggered by hormonal changes – can all cause the same symptoms. ""Often we see patients with persistent pre-menopausal pelvic pain, which is often due to a benign condition. And they may not realise that they have also caused a pelvic infection, which is associated with an increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease and pelvic cancer. Many women who are misdiagnosed with a pre-menopausal condition are at an increased risk of developing a long-term pelvic infection, and can have symptoms which go back and forth, but which appear to resolve in different ways, which are very hard to pick up on."" The researchers analysed data from more than 14,000 women aged between 22 and 39. Dr Safford explains that they wanted to look at the question as it was ""particularly relevant to women"". She adds that ""We didn't want to just look at the number of women who were diagnosed at a pre-menopausal age – because that would be a very narrow sample to study."" The most common diagnosis made for pre-menopausal women was ""prostate-specific antigen"" type 2 (PSAT-2). This is a blood test which the body can use as a proxy to determine whether a woman is female. It is the same test used to make early detection of cervical cancer, among other things. Although the researchers did not investigate why the PSA-2 test was more often incorrectly used for pre-menopausal women, they say their aim was not to blame men or their testosterone levels or to suggest that women should be more aware of their body's hormones when it comes to dating, sex, and relationships. Dr Safford acknowledges, for those who need to be reassured, ""women should always go to their doctor."" But she adds, ""I'd just as soon see a therapist who knows what to look for."" This is particularly important because there are a number of conditions which can cause pelvic pain and symptoms that are similar or similar to pre-menopausal women such as: Interstitial Cystitis - these conditions are caused by inflammation and scarring inside the bladder. Women are more likely to have pain during sexual intercourse Interstitial Cystitis can lead to pain during periods, or pain around the rectum Endometriosis (a womb-like lump in the womb) Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) – causes severe pain at the bladder, bowel or cervix, which often goes away after an initial bout of treatment Ultrasound scans - can find ""hidden"" cancer that is not on a mammogram by looking for a lump in the abdomen when women are not wearing a bra To find out more about how pelvic pain and symptoms affect women, we asked Dr Safford: What are the common differences between men and women in terms of pain and symptoms: how long do they usually deal with their pain and symptoms, and what do women go through that men do not? ""Women's pain tends to come on slowly when they are doing something they find very sensitive like climbing a flight of stairs. They can feel the pressure in their pelvic bone as they go up the stairs, but they don't know how it is getting there or where the pain is coming from. Sometimes it is hard to put your finger on",1,ai
"Derek Landis had no clue his girlfriend would be in the front seat of his car during his birthday celebration. But when a stranger drove by his apartment on the East Side that morning, there was another surprise waiting for Derek — who found himself in the middle of a massive traffic stop while she had a gun and her three kids were in the backseat. The woman and a 2-year-old were also arrested after the accident. Now Derek says his life is on hold and with it the ability to spend money for his family. ""The cops are really being ridiculous and it's wrong. It's not fair,"" Derek said through tears. A woman was driving erratically in the 9500 block of East 82nd Street Tuesday around 4:35 p.m., according the Chicago Police Department's news release. She was stopped a short distance away. While sitting in the front passenger seat of her vehicle, the woman, later identified as 27-year-old Marissa Huling of Joliet, had a handgun and her three children under the age of 12 with her. Police said they believe she was attempting to elude arrest at the time. She was also carrying a child into the car, police said. Both the children and the woman were taken into custody. The woman told police she was returning to her apartment from work to use the restroom and pulled into the apartment complex's parking lot to use the restroom to check for any vehicles she may have missed, police said. That's when she saw a black SUV, which had its headlights off, driving erratically in the area and noticed it was a police car behind her. She pulled into her apartment and pulled up the driver's side window to call 911 on her phone, the release said. The SUV pulled over and she exited her vehicle. The SUV then stopped in front of her apartment, and the woman exited the vehicle to do business as well. While the woman was doing her business, Huling left her apartment and then returned to her vehicle, police said. Police say the SUV drove past Huling's car twice. The second time, she got out of her vehicle. The SUV then drove off. The woman and her vehicle went a short distance and Huling stopped her vehicle and told her to exit, police said. But the woman refused to exit and continued to follow Huling. Police said Huling then exited her vehicle to talk to the woman when the SUV pulled up behind her, driving at very high speeds. The SUV swerved into Huling's lane and the vehicle collided with the curb. Paramedics took both from the area to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where they were treated for minor injuries. Huling was charged with aggravated fleeing from a police officer, a Class 4 felony. She was also cited for driving with an expired vehicle registration, no insurance, no proof of insurance and three counts of reckless driving, a Class 4 felony. Huling and her children were transported to Area Two juvenile detention, police said. After the accident, authorities began looking for Derek, but his car was stolen. After finding out the car had been stolen, Derek received a call from his boyfriend informing him that he had to remain at the house. The boyfriend then found out that the SUV had been sold and it was now at an auction, police said. ""I said 'How did this happen to you?' He goes 'I don't know, they took it off us,' and I said, 'Oh my god. All right, I understand. I wish you could take me home,'"" Derek said through tears about the time he had to stay at the home with his girlfriend.",1,ai

"1) ""Won't the girls like me so much less if I'm single?!"" A few weeks ago, a post on Tumblr by a friend of mine went viral — if you haven't been on there, you need to be because the world is changing. ""There have been more than a few instances where I've looked at a potential date and thought 'Dang, I really like her but she's so single I wonder if I could take her out again!' I'm not even necessarily jealous, it's just a feeling I get. There's this thing that girls are afraid of but we have it for a reason. It's our fear of change."" Advertisement - Continue Reading Below If she's still single, you shouldn't let fear stop you from being attractive to her because her past relationship doesn't mean ""she's doomed forever"" to be alone again. You can tell that a girl has taken a leap of faith into your arms and is comfortable with you (assuming she's still single) because: 1. She's smart as hell, which means she knows that she does not need a guy in order to grow as a woman. I've always said, ""Your value only comes from the women that will love you."" I'm not saying that you need a boyfriend of 10 years to make your woman feel complete, because that isn't true; but the woman that will love you will love you for the person you are — not because she needs a ""boyfriend"" to feel complete. 2. A new relationship and the whole new dating experience is scary (even for us introverted guys — don't worry we want you to know that if it is still scary, you're doing so right!), and that's where women's fears often come. It's a scary world out there, and our instincts are telling us that we're more likely to get hurt, rejected, and worse than someone who's been in the same situation before. 3. She doesn't have that fear in her past relationship because she's already been through it and survived it. If you have a lot of success dating women past college, what's stopping her from going back to that place? 4. Your past relationship doesn't put a damper on how much you can be confident with women. I've been dating since the age of 23 and never dated a girl under 30 before college. I was in college dating 30 year-old girls when I was 25 years old, but now you'd be amazed how many guys still think my age is relevant, and think they could make some girls jealous. Women are not like a dog that looks for a good home because it's the oldest dog they have who is still in the litter, so if you're going to date a young girl or anyone else with young kids and feel insecure about that, then think about this: it's the single most successful dating strategy you'll ever find. 5. If you're not happy with your current women, you should be happy with every girl you date. Just because you may have dated a lot of younger girls doesn't mean that you should continue to date all of them. I've dated women much younger than me, but still love all of them. I wouldn't be where I am if I hadn't dated women from all different ages and backgrounds. If something isn't working for you, keep it because you may one day find that you find a different person with whom you fit. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 6. What's true for you is not necessarily true for all your other male friends. Your female friends can tell you if you're having relationship issues because they've dealt with it at their own pace (not you) before. Your male friends will probably all tell you that it's fine with them no matter what. 7. Women don't date men for money. You hear that all the time so don't believe it. Money isn't the reason they end up with the man in front of them or the girl next to him. In that same Reddit post, our friend, who's now married, states that she went on four dates before marrying her husband: two of which were guys that she had met on Tinder. She didn't date him for the money, she just liked the person that went on two of those dates. Her other four dates involved her dating older men — men who could help her start a career in her field while providing financial security. 8. If you think that dating women past the age of 20 might hinder your career goals, think again. In his piece published at The New York Times, The Big Secret, writer John Bogle shares the advice he offered 20-year-old John McNamee: ""Young women in their 20s seem to have given up on the idea of marrying young. Instead, they have focused on having fun and enjoying their own lives, leaving a lot of men behind. There's still a way",1,ai

"o Consul Kane, Colonel Blake, and this Captain Maraniss fellow explain the past 10,000 years to me. The Consul opened up some very old forgotten Galactic records on the computer that revealed the history of this planet. Earth. ``Earth?'' I said to myself. That was the planet that I had seen in these records long ago as a child. Turns out, humanity was established on this planet thousands of years ago, in a very advanced civilization, but for unknown reasons decided to find a new home amongst the stars. So they left, taking all their technology with them. Those that remained were the outcasts ; the slaves, thieves, and uneducated people. Nobody that could read or write. They were given nothing to survive, so they had to adapt. Building tools out of stones and developing their own societies, language, and culture. Their history before this time was forgotten, and through their own minds they flourished, despite not knowing what was beyond their own solar system. Once the",0,human
"The showcase McNamara Alumni Center at the University of Minnesota acts as a visitor center, office building and event center on the Minneapolis campus. With a striking granite-covered, geode-shaped exterior and impressive 85-foot atrium, the structure is a new landmark on the East Bank gateway to the campus. Inside the ultra-modern building is an ultra-modern Daikin Magnitude magnetic bearing compressor chiller, providing impressive operating cost savings for the university. The 231,000-square foot Alumni Center building opened in 2000 before magnetic bearing chillers were available. Another 550-ton chiller with a traditional centrifugal compressor was originally installed in the building. Jon McCombs, operations manager at the Alumni Center, managed by United Properties' Corporate Solutions division, wanted the reliability and redundancy of a second chiller for the building. ""I wouldn't recommend any building owner, especially where they have this kind of run time, not to have some redundancy. Yet two of those large, traditional machines wouldn't have fit in our equipment room."" Finding a backup-chiller The 300-ton Daikin Magnitude chiller was the perfect solution to supplement the building's original machine and was installed in 2006. According to Schwab Volhaber Lubratt, the Daikin representative in St. Paul, Minn., the compact footprint, part-load performance and quiet operation of the Daikin Magnitude chiller was their recommendation to meet the requirements of the Alumni Center with an almost immediate payback on energy savings. The Daikin 300-ton magnetic bearing compressor chiller was the clear leader to be the back-up chiller, McCombs says. ""Weight was one of the first hurdles we had to overcome. The quiet operation of the Daikin Magnitude chiller allowed us to avoid installing it on a housekeeping pad, used to isolate sound, thus greatly reducing the weight and physical foot print."" The magnetic bearing compressor weighs a fraction of a typical centrifugal compressor. McCombs adds, ""Our previous weight restriction for the open area prior to installing the new chiller was 125 pounds per square foot. We were able to de-rate the remaining area to 100 pounds per square foot and meet the structural engineer's live load requirement."" The compact design of the chiller – at approximately 12 feet by under 48 inches, including the electrical panel – also made a difference, McCombs says. ""We had a very tight design. The electrical panel needed to have a three-foot clearance to meet code. We are extremely close to three feet yet have adequate room for service. Given the size and weight of the machine, we ended up with the maximum machine possible as far as shell size and physical weight restrictions."" Another feature in favor of the Daikin Magnitude chiller was the easy integration with the existing Johnson Controls Metasys® building automation system installed in the Alumni Center. The chiller communicates important control and monitoring information to the Metasys system using BACnet®, the standard open protocol developed by ASHRAE, the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers. Maintenance savings The magnetic bearing compressors of the Daikin Magnitude chiller eliminate the maintenance associated with oil handling equipment. Also, McCombs says the shell and tube design of the Daikin chiller won out over other chillers that use plate heat exchangers for ease of maintenance. ""The ease of service and long-term benefit of having a copper tube design over a stainless steel plate heat exchanger means there are no parts to wear out and very few components ever get replaced,"" McCombs says. He notes that annual maintenance on the Daikin chiller involves inspecting the electrical connections and cleaning the condenser and evaporator tubes with a rotary brush.",0,human

"The NFL schedule is out, and people across the country are furiously booking hotel rooms and flights to ensure they're present for some phenomenal matchups this year. NFL.com has already put together the ultimate road trip for fans based on the top NFL games of the 2015 season, but what about those who love college football as much as the NFL? College Football 24/7 is here to help and has assembled the top-five road trips for college football and NFL games in 2015. Each week might not feature the absolute best college football or NFL matchup, but rather, the best combination of games that fans could easily attend over a weekend. 1. Primetime comes to Indiana USC at Notre Dame, 7:30 p.m. ET on Oct. 17 Patriots at Colts , 8:30 p.m. ET on Oct 18151 miles between South Bend and IndianapolisIt's hard to get much better than this pairing. One of the best rivalry games in all of college football will pit a pair of top 15 teams against each other in South Bend, where the Trojans and Fighting Irish will look to get a nice win on their College Football Playoff resume in primetime. After things wrap up under the watchful eyes of Touchdown Jesus, you can take the drive down 31 to Indy and catch Andrew Luck and Tom Brady square off yet again in the Sunday Night Football game, which will be a rematch of last season's AFC Championship Game. There should be plenty of good quarterbacks in action on this road trip, and plenty of talent showing what they can do under the lights. 2. Rivalry Week meets Turkey Day NFL game: Eagles at Lions, 12:30 p.m. ET on Nov. 26 College game: Ohio State at Michigan on Nov. 28 Distance: 45 miles between Ford Field and the Big House, Michigan Stadium, in Ann Arbor. The skinny: NFL and college football fans have plenty to give thanks for on this weekend. The annual Thanksgiving Day game features Chip Kelly's Eagles (and possibly a pair of Heisman Trophy winners at quarterback) traveling to face Matthew Stafford and the Detroit Lions, a playoff team last season looking to do more in 2015. That game should have plenty of wide-open offense, which NFL and college fans won't mind. Two days later, Jim Harbaugh takes to the field for his first rivalry game as head coach of the Wolverines, and it just so happens to be against Urban Meyer and the defending national champion Buckeyes. Hard to have more compelling storylines than this two-game swing. Top 10 rivalry games SEE PHOTOS These are the top 10 college football rivalry games, as determined by the College Football 24/7 staff. 3. Texas two-step Texas vs. Oklahoma on Oct. 10 Patriots at Cowboys , 4:25 p.m. ET on Oct. 1120 miles between the Cotton Bowl and AT&T StadiumThe Red River Rivalry game is a matchup every football fan has to put on his bucket list, given that it pits two powerhouse programs against each other at the fabled Cotton Bowl. Throw in the atmosphere of the Texas state fair, the great fried food available, and the split along the 50-yard line between burnt orange and crimson, and it's not hard to see why this is a special game. The next day doesn't slack off in terms of football either -- the defending Super Bowl champions head to Dallas to take on Tony Romo and the title-contending Cowboys . Throw in a lunch trip to the famed Pecan Lodge in Dallas for BBQ, and you're golden. 4. Lone Star, three stops NFL games: Panthers at Cowboys, 4:30 p.m. ET on Nov. 26; Saints at Texans, 1 p.m. ET on Nov. 29 College game: Baylor at TCU on Nov. 27 Distance: 264 miles between AT&T Stadium and NRG Stadium The skinny: If No. 2 on this list doesn't float your boat for Thanksgiving weekend, this Texas road trip might. You can start off on Turkey Day with the Panthers and Cowboys, which brings the interesting sub-plot of being the first game for Greg Hardy against his old team. The following day you can catch the Big 12 game of the year -- a grudge match between TCU and Baylor in what might be for a spot in the College Football Playoff. Finally, you can cap things off with a trip down I-45 to catch the Saints and Texans duking things out. If you're really adventurous, you can even detour to Baton Rouge, La., for Texas A&M vs. LSU. 5. California road trip NFL games: Seahawks at 49ers, 8:25 p.m. ET on Oct. 22; Raiders at Chargers, 4:05 p.m. ET on Oct. 25 College games: Utah State at San Diego State on Oct. 23; Utah at USC",0,human
"The ""Torture Program"" of the CIA during the Obama administration was a covert effort to secretly conduct interrogations of al-Qaeda and Taliban detainees against their will, according to the Senate Intelligence Committee report on the torture program released Tuesday. ""I have read and carefully studied the classified executive summary and the declassified portions of the report, and can affirm that the CIA's coercive interrogation methods were not an effective tool in getting intelligence from detainees,"" said a statement released by Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Dianne Feinstein of California, whose committee's report revealed the existence of the secret prison in foreign territory where interrogations were undertaken. ""I will continue to oppose this program, which has misled the American people and undermined our national security,"" Feinstein, who was a member of the Intelligence Committee that had conducted the study, said in a statement. ""The public may recall the CIA's 'enhanced interrogation' techniques, such as rectal feeding and rectal rehydration, were not an option for use during the initial 9/11 Commission study."" Feinstein added in the statement that she would ""remain vigilant"" against the return of CIA interrogation techniques. According to documents leaked to the Intercept, the CIA used so-called ""enhanced interrogation"" for three decades, starting in the 1980s under the administration of former President Reagan, and is believed to have worked with U.S. allies. Many members of Congress, human rights groups and former officials have long demanded that the Obama administration shut down the CIA interrogation program, which they claimed was torture. Read the full text of the Feinstein statement below: ""As I stated in a public statement last month, the Senate Intelligence Committee's study of the CIA's detention and interrogation program, while critical in many respects, is incomplete and does not answer some key questions. It fails to account for a number of circumstances that have the potential to diminish its findings. Specifically, it does not address important issues such as the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques — known as ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" or ""EITs,"" — on obtaining actionable intelligence from al-Qaeda, on Abu Zubaydah, or on detainee detainees. I have read and carefully studied the classified executive summary and the declassified portions of the report, and can affirm that the CIA's coercive interrogation methods were not an effective tool in getting intelligence from detainees. I am therefore disturbed by the CIA's continued attempts to withhold certain information related to those detention and interrogation techniques and will work to ensure that the fullest possible accounting, including CIA representations, is provided to the Department of Justice's Office of the Inspector General. I will continue to oppose this program, which has misled the American people and undermined our national security. As I have stated, I remain unconvinced that torture worked and that information gained through such techniques should have been used as the basis for any legal opinions, statutes, regulations or public comments from this or any other government agency."" The Senate report released Tuesday detailed the agency's history of using torture in its effort to find clues on the whereabouts of Osama Bin Laden, who was killed by U.S. special forces in Pakistan on May 2, 2011. According to the report, the agency first began experimenting with the techniques after the 9/11 attacks in response to intelligence gleaned from the interrogation of a detainee at Guantanamo Bay that the agency had interrogated for information related to Al Qaeda. As the agency was training its own detainees in its use, the techniques were eventually used on numerous other inmates. In addition to Abu Zubaydah, three other high-value detainees were also waterboarded repeatedly during the course of a year or so, and other techniques were employed on detainees Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri. The agency was accused of violating the Fourth Geneva Convention by subjecting the two prisoners to brutal interrogation methods, such as shackling them in small, windowless boxes, subjecting them to waterboarding to ""intense, prolonged periods of drowning, stress positions and dietary manipulation."" Following the release of the report, CIA Director John Brennan took to the agency's blog to defend the use of torture, arguing that it was an effective tool in obtaining information from terrorist detainees and, specifically, that information gained from interrogations of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.",1,ai
"The United Kingdom has joined the United States in urging its citizens not to go to Syria but if they do it should be for strictly humanitarian reasons, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said on Friday. Mr. Hammond was speaking at a meeting with the United States' ambassador to the United Kingdom David Miliband in London on Friday. ""I am concerned that people who are interested in travelling to Syria to join the civil war there are doing so for purposes other than helping the people of Syria,"" Mr. Hammond said. Mr. Hammond said those who had left Britain to fight in Syria had not engaged, trained or given humanitarian aid to the Syrian people. ""We hope the British people will do the rest of us a great favour and not get involved in that sort of nonsense,"" he said. Mr. Miliband said that Britain was also worried by reports that Syria has a chemical weapons program. ""We have every reason to believe that Syria has some military capabilities, even if it cannot yet use them,"" he said. Britain has been taking steps to strengthen its defenses, including putting into place new military training courses.

"Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Scientists hope new DNA tools will help them to look for potential cancer 'hot spots' Tests that use only a single molecule might one day be able to target the mutated DNA that is most likely to cause a disease, researchers have said. Researchers at Cancer Research UK and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) London said the technique could lead to earlier, more effective treatments. The research is in phase 2 and aims to test the strategy on a large number of tumours. It has been reported in the journal Science. Some patients have already benefited from such new techniques because of their ability to spot changes in DNA long before the disease manifests itself. In many cases these changes appear to be harmless at the time that they first occur but go on to produce cancer. 'Huge potential' The researchers at Coventry, together with colleagues from the University of Glasgow, will use these ""DNA scalpel"" tests to look for the most sensitive marker - known as the DNA methylation status - that reflects ""hot spots"" in mutated DNA - areas in which cancer cells are particularly prone to developing and spreading. The researchers will also monitor the DNA methylation status in samples from patients before they have symptoms and then again after they have recovered. They hope that by tracking the changes, and the way in which they appear to be associated with cancers, they will be able to target the areas with the greatest chance of having a major impact on survival rates. Prof Terry Davies, scientific adviser to the Wellcome Trust and the medical director to Cancer Research UK, told the BBC News website: ""If you know that a particular mutated DNA region is linked to an increased risk, or if you can show that a patient has this type of DNA, you will have a much better chance of being able to remove this section of DNA from their DNA - if and when it does get turned on again. ""You could potentially give somebody the option of either stopping their disease altogether and letting the tumour grow uncontrolled, or removing that mutated area as a way of stopping that disease becoming a cancer. ""By doing this on the spot we can also detect other mutations - and this will enable us to work out what the underlying cause of a given problem is - and try and treat it earlier rather than waiting to see if and when something else goes awry."" Professor Mike Jacobs, chief executive at Cancer Research UK, and a researcher who is leading the project, added: ""This is a huge step forward to help us understand more about the mechanisms underlying cancer and to understand how we might be able to combat these tumours. ""This will inform our decisions as far as whether there's something we're missing with current therapies. It may also provide ways of predicting the likely course of patients' cancers."" The researchers plan to enroll more than 5,000 healthy non-cancerous blood cells from patients affected with cancer.",1,ai

"How a little known drug is revolutionising diabetes treatment By Niki Delgado Gass BBC News New drugs and new ways to control diabetes A revolution for the control of the disease may be about to follow a decade of investigation. Diabetes affects more than 30m people, of which nearly 400,000 die each year. New drugs and new ways to control diabetes are in development, but researchers are worried that this will come to a halt without a way to improve diabetes control. Until the 1970s, people with diabetic neuropathy - the nerve damage found in some cases following damage to the main nerves in the body - could only rely on a patch covering both feet - and this was painful and impractical. But some researchers at the time thought that there could be ways to bypass that foot patch in a more modern device. So one of them, John Fotheringham of the University of Nottingham in UK, asked a few questions. He looked at the properties of a substance often called oleuropein. Oleuropein is a natural extract from a snail and is thought to have beneficial properties for the body - it contains anti-oxidants and is said to aid tissue regeneration. In his tests, it caused ""a dramatic increase in the ability of the peripheral nerve to regenerate in the footpad"" which was ""amazingly rapid and robust"". Using this new patch, patients no longer had to wear a patch to cover their foot but could now wear a foot covering without the pain and the difficulties of wearing three layers of socks. The patch was put into the market for the treatment of foot ulcers - in many cases, it worked immediately, he said. But there was trouble in paradise. As one can imagine, the cost of getting a new drug to market is huge. Fotheringham then noticed his patch was being used, again, not so much to control the foot ulcer but perhaps more surprisingly, to treat people with Type 1 diabetes who lost their ability to produce insulin because they had lost their nerve receptors in the pancreas. A second patch came onto the market, which works in a different way. But as these approaches did not work well for all diabetic patients, Fotheringham thought they lacked a universal application. This gave him the idea of adding a fourth patch to the market. This patch, called insulin-injected sensor, works by activating the body's own cells which produce insulin. It is not the same as the new insulin. It does not get pumped straight into the blood. Instead, it is given directly into a person's blood. The new technology was not designed with patients in mind. But once it has done the trick, Fotheringham thinks ""it'd be very surprising if there isn't a third patch that goes on to work in an entirely different situation"". Fotheringham's ideas came to a head in 1998 when he took the research into his own hands and started work on diabetes and peripheral nerve damage in a mouse model. His results came from testing a device called a miniature insulin release strip. This tiny patch, about 5mm square, has already shown promise and could help some 10m people in the UK with diabetes. And it could be only a matter of time before it is given to patients, Fotheringham hopes. And, when that moment comes, he hopes, other diseases that use peripheral nerves may be able to benefit from a new approach. This is the story of the discovery of insulin-injectable sensor.",1,ai

"I think that the problem is more fundamental than that. I find that the more I try to think of a problem from a purely scientific viewpoint, the more I get really hung up about whether a given solution to the problem I'm looking at actually does fit that description. In one sense, there was no problem at all: ""You'll never convince me that there is an actual physical process that causes me to do X"" just doesn't have much traction in the abstract. (I don't know that this is the best way to say it, but it's close enough.) But in another sense, there actually was a problem, and I am just seeing it in another way than I should. It's not that the problem that I've set out to explain is incorrect; the real problem is just that I'm seeing it through the lens of a model that is based only on the most direct and parsimonious description of the relevant physical mechanisms. When I describe ""causality"", I'm not talking about physical mechanisms, but rather about mathematical objects that describe them, including properties like whether the resulting processes can happen in time. (That said, to get further information about the problem, I can always ask a more technical question like ""Does X have the property that causes a certain result to happen?"" and if the answer is ""that's definitely what causes it"", then I can assume that the question I'm asking was really about causation. If the answer is ""it appears to have that property,"" then I have to get back to the problem I care most about, and that's the problem that I'm describing, and it's the problem that I really wanted to answer.) It may seem that this is a hopelessly circular argument about the nature of science that I am describing, but I think that it's actually better that I think of it in this way than that I do not. This is because it shows me where my ignorance is, which, in turn, brings me closer to figuring out how to improve my knowledge. At the start of all this, I thought that I was wrong: that I couldn't actually prove that some physical process causes something to happen, and that all of my knowledge came from observations that convinced me that there must be such a process, but now I've come closer to figuring out what the actual physical processes are, and I have a much better idea of how to learn more about them. I'd like to think that this is just the beginning of my journey towards a more rational and scientific understanding of science, but unfortunately, it may be not. There can be no escape from the fact that the only way I know how to deal with the world as it is is to attempt to understand it as best I can, using my existing knowledge of scientific principles, so it's always going to be a long, uphill journey from here. I hope that you'll find it helpful to do as I've described, and if at any point you find yourself wondering how I came to the conclusions that you do (or feel that I could be right and that my understanding of the world is just not what you expected), then this may help answer that.",1,ai
"Acoustic Communication by Barry Truax Coursework The central point of Barry Truax’s acoustic study is the “acoustic community”. Truax defines it as “any soundscape in which acoustic information plays a pervasive role in the lives of the inhabitants…it is any system within which acoustic information is exchanged.” (Truax, 65 – 66) Drawing from this expanded and specific definition, acoustic communities can be groups of people working together in one office, students that study in a classroom or live in a dormitory or even whole villages and towns where the acoustic environment is the same for all their inhabitants. On the basis of the above-presented definition of the acoustic community, I can state that I have also been a member of such a community. Once, I had an opportunity to rent a flat in a multi-story house where I had many neighbors. I am convinced that this experience of mine can be called living in an acoustic community because, according to Truax (2000), acoustic information played a pervasive role in the lives of all inhabitants and participated in the information exchange. The sounds that were typical of that acoustic community ranged from the quarrels of neighboring families to announcements made for all the inhabitants regarding the need to pay the rent or carry out some repair works in the house’s gas supply system, etc. The keynotes, signals and sound marks were essential for creating the community, as acoustic information present in it was not always relevant for all its members and was considered to be noise by those who did not relate to it directly. Thus, the acoustic community was functional because all its members could obtain useful information from the acoustic environment; at the same time, it was unbalanced as acoustic information was not always relevant to the needs of all the community members.

"It's generally a good idea for college students to start investing as early as possible in order to take advantage of the power of compound interest. However, the amount that you should invest will depend on a variety of factors, including your personal financial situation, your risk tolerance, and your long-term financial goals.Here are a few things to consider when determining how much to invest:Start with an emergency fund: Before you start investing in stocks, it's important to have an emergency fund in place to cover unexpected expenses. This should be a liquid, low-risk savings account that you can access easily in case of an emergency.Determine your risk tolerance: Stocks can be volatile, so it's important to consider your risk tolerance when deciding how much to invest. If you're comfortable with a higher level of risk, you may be able to invest a larger portion of your savings in stocks. However, if you're more risk-averse, you may want to consider investing a smaller portion in stocks and keeping the rest in safer, lower-risk investments such as bonds or money market funds.Consider your long-term goals: Think about your long-term financial goals and how much time you have to reach them. If you have a longer time horizon, you may be able to afford to take on more risk, since you'll have more time to ride out any market ups and downs. However, if you have a shorter time horizon, you may want to be more conservative with your investments.It's also a good idea to consult with a financial advisor or professional to get personalized advice on how much to invest based on your specific circumstances.",1,ai

"After the police were called, the man attempted to jump down to the ground from his fourth-floor apartment. In a bizarre and horrifying turn of events, a man accused of trying to grope a child fell from a fourth story window to his death while trying to evade police. The New York Daily News reported that Edgar Collaguazo, 44, fell from the fourth floor of a Queens, N.Y. apartment at 1:05 a.m. on Thursday after trying to escape from a locked room as the police were coming. The night began joyously for the residents of a Jackson Heights apartment owned by Collaguazo. A family who rented a room from him was celebrating the birthday of their six-year-old son, when Collaguazo arrived back at the apartment the evening of Wednesday, Nov. 9. At one point in the night, Collaguazo invited at least three kids, including the birthday boy, his five-year-old female cousin, and another boy, into his room to watch a movie. The parents were initially unalarmed by this action, but when the little girl emerged from the room acting strangely, they began to worry. ""The little girl was happy and well, and then suddenly, she came out, but…she looked different,"" the birthday boy's mother said. The boy's father then checked in clandestinely but didn't witness anything out of the ordinary. However, when the mother of the girl went to peek in, she saw Collaguazo holding the six-year-old boy on his lap, with his hand on the boy's privates. She went directly to the boy's mother. ""She came to me frightened and crying,"" the boy's mom said. ""We never thought the man had a mind this dirty."" The room erupted into chaos as the fathers of the children began beating Collaguazo. ""I told them, 'Stop beating him, already! I have called the police,'"" the victim's mother remembered. The family then locked Collaguazo in his room until the police could arrive. It was then that Collaguazo decided to make a break for it. He attempted to jump down to the ground from his fourth-floor apartment. As seen on surveillance video obtained from the location, he did not make it to the ground alive. Jose Valentine, who was staying at a friend's apartment across from Collaguazo's remembers the events of that night. ""The guy had one foot on the ledge trying to climb over the bars,"" he recalled. ""He let himself go head first and landed with a thud and splatter. It sounded like a pumpkin fell off the roof."" In the video, it can be seen that Collaguazo landed belly-first into an iron fence. Police rushed him to Elmhurst Hospital, where doctors were unable to save him. ""If he didn't have a filthy mind, he'd simply stay and face the situation,"" the mother of the molested boy said.

"A recent photo shows a police officer giving Tanisha Anderson a ride home from a convenience store after Anderson pulled out a handgun and shot at two plainclothes officers. She shot and wounded her sister-in-law, Tanisha Alexander. Officers later shot and killed her. (Photo: John Minchillo/AP) A black Baton Rouge police lieutenant was shot and killed by a civilian last week after officers responded to a domestic disturbance call. Police Chief Carl Dabadie Jr. said Tuesday the fatal shooting by a single gunman last Wednesday morning was ""an isolated incident.'' Lt. Montrell Jackson was one of 19 people killed in law enforcement shootings in 2016. So far in 2017, nine members of the national law enforcement fraternity have been killed in the line of duty, according to FBI statistics. The latest law enforcement death occurred in a Baton Rouge suburb where officers said a woman fatally shot herself in an apparent suicide attempt. Tanisha Anderson, 29, was arrested Wednesday for an alleged weapons violation. She was placed in a patrol car at 8 a.m. on an incident report of an armed woman in a convenience store. According to police, Anderson entered the convenience store and pointed a gun at two officers. One officer and the woman inside fired weapons. She died at the scene. Officers returned to the store after receiving reports that the woman had shot herself in the hand and arm, but she later died from her wounds. It was not clear if or how she had been armed, but investigators said the firearm was apparently not her own. Anderson and her sister-in-law, Tanisha Alexander, were married. They were in their basement with other children for a birthday party. Anderson said she had called 911 to report what she thought was a domestic dispute that turned physical. She had told police she fired a single shot at a police car, a fact contradicted by a statement she allegedly said to a dispatcher. Police said officers have ""not found any evidence that supports"" that claim. The woman in custody has not been publicly identified. But the Baton Rouge Advocate reports that Anderson did have a loaded 9mm handgun with her at the time of her arrest. The scene at Anderson's place of residence just east of Interstate 10 and Wanda Highway. (Photo: YouTube) Jackson, who joined the Baton Rouge Police Department in 2004, was not at the scene Friday morning. His body was found in an unmarked armored vehicle around 2 a.m. at a house near Interstate 10 and Wanda Highway, according to Lt. Col. Mike Edmonson, a Baton Rouge police spokesman. ""At some unknown time between 1 [a.m.] and 2 [a.m.] a family member made a call to say that she needed help,"" Edmonson said. ""When police arrived, she pulled a weapon. When police fired at her, she was struck and ultimately killed. An officer was hit. One of the other officers was injured. Both officers are now recovering."" Alexander was taken to a hospital and later was pronounced dead. A preliminary investigation has determined Anderson shot herself in the hand and arm. The case is under investigation by the West Baton Rouge Parish District Attorney's Office, Edmonson said. A criminal investigation is ongoing. A Facebook page under the person of Tanisha Alexander, who lives in Lake Providence, was filled with posts Thursday expressing condolences to family and friends and lamenting the loss of her daughter.

Police spokeswoman Cpl. L'Jean McKneely confirmed that Alexander had recently moved out of the Anderson's home. ""We had concerns about a woman who lived in the Anderson home in that she just showed up one day who we couldn't track down,"" she said.

"Loyalty or Reward Program and Its Aspects Essay The first aspect of an eminent loyalty program is uniqueness. The current business environment can be characterized as overcrowded, so the customers should have some kind of reason to engage in the rewards program. Another contributing factor is the prevalence of club cards, membership cards, and other similar assets intended to reward the customer (Baxter, 2015). Nonetheless, the customers are unsure about these rewards because they are never told about the benefits of having such cards. It is critical to inform the customers about the upsides of becoming a loyal client and expose them to the real value of being a part of the rewards program. The uniqueness of the offer will never put the business at a disadvantage. By letting the customers know what the benefits are, the business will be able to make the most out of this interactive customer-business collaboration. On a bigger scale, communicating the goals and advantages of the loyalty program to the customers is one of the best things that can highlight the uniqueness of the business and make it stand out among other competitors (Searls, 2012). Expanding on the topic of unique membership, then businesses may be interested in developing a scheme that will function based on engagement points. This aspect of the loyalty program can only contribute to its success only when it is approached with responsibility and extensive knowledge in the area (Searls, 2012). The two of the most popular models that can be used here are point-of-sale and transaction. Engagement points may be perceived as an indirect discount as the accumulated points will reduce the price of certain products in the future. This aspect of the loyalty program majorly relates to the customers’ psychological behavior and perception of business as a whole (Baxter, 2015). In other words, customers start spending more to receive more rewards. Such programs are beneficial for businesses because they are increasing customer value within a relatively short time frame. Also, the engagement points scheme can be expanded using employing a catalog-driven approach where the customers will be proposed to buy things in a package instead of purchasing them separately. Therefore, the customers will be elicited to buy packages that include some novel products in addition to those that were usually bought before. If we connect the loyalty program to each of the aspects of the business, we will get an all-inclusive rewards program. Outlining a purchase-positive behavior in customers is critical, and the key to making them buy the products that are offered by the organization is to keep them interested in the business’s services (Searls, 2012). To stir up interest in the new commercial proposals, the business should treat its customers with high-quality content. In most cases, customers are only interested in loyalty programs when they look or sound good. This has to do with behavioral psychology and its connection to the buying behavior patterns. For instance, a successful company may ruin its marketing strategy by turning its loyalty program into a means of communicating the list of available products to its customers (Baxter, 2015). Instead, the business should provide the latter with relevant, unique, and useful content that will help them, not overwhelm them. Using social media is also a great addition to the available options for sharing the company’s content. Using these online ads, the company will be able to inform the customers about the value of the rewards program in a recurrent manner and keep them interested. References Baxter, R. (2015).

"Fight Club: An Analysis of the Film by David Fincher Essay It is a film about the fragility of masculinity, men’s mental health, and how they are interconnected. Fight Club is a crude portrait of what happens when men’s insecurities turn into masculinity in overdrive. Thus, this film represents toxic masculinity. Fight Club shows men dissatisfied with the state of masculinity. The characters are different in that many of them were raised by their mothers because their fathers either left the family or got divorced. According to Ta, the result is that the characters see themselves as “a generation of men raised by women” (270). In their life there is not enough male education for the formation of their masculinity. It confirms the idea of phallocentrism, which is based on the image of castrated women. Women raise children so that they can enter into the symbolic order. Fight Club is a wicked satire about finding, nurturing, and destroying yourself. It challenges ideas of masculinity, adding to the image of a real man several features that can be called associative and setting self-destruction and a destructive impact on society as one of life’s goals. The victory of Jack’s subpersonality over Tyler on the roof of a skyscraper shows that the good in a real man can overcome the destructive element. The ability to self-sacrifice and responsibility for his actions in Jack, who has gone through the evolution of masculinity, inspires some optimism, but the finale remains open.",0,human
"Cancer and Reproductive Harm- Cancer and Reproductive Harm- www.P65Warnings.ca.gov For the first time ever, Ruger has engineered a semi-automatic handgun to utilize Ruger's newly-developed 10-round fixed magazine. A 10-round magazine is the equivalent of 2 magazines in the average handgun. This makes the Ruger SR-556 a single-shot pistol without the need for a reload. An accessory rail also provides for mounting of lights, lasers, or the like. The 10-round fixed magazine is made from durable high-carbon steel, and boasts full-length dust cover, polymer grip-deck, and stainless steel spring and feed lips.

"Antitrust Claims: Microsoft Corporation Case Coursework Antitrust law as highlighted in section 2 of the Sherman Act seeks to safeguard small companies from any company that has monopoly power and can use its position to fix prices and exclude competition (Jones, 2000). Microsoft Corporation, a computer software manufacturing giant based in the United States has been accused severally for the violation of the antitrust law. One such civil suit was initiated in the year 2002 where Microsoft faced a civil suit by the United States for monopolization, which is against the antitrust law. In this civil case, Microsoft was found guilty of monopolization where it was found to use its financial power to fix prices in the market so as to exclude competition. In this civil suit against Microsoft, the company was found to occupy more than 80% of the total market share as many computers in the market use Intel chips which in turn use operating systems that are Intel compatible. This has made Microsoft Company to dominate the market as it is the main distributor of Windows Operating Systems that are Intel compatible. Another civil case against Microsoft was initiated by 19 states in the year 2007 where it was accused of violating the antitrust law. In this case, the software giant was accused of using anti-competitive means to lock out its competitors out of the market by using application barriers. The company was accused of blocking the use of middle-ware products that act as platforms to facilitate users to use any operating system of their choice. Microsoft was also accused of threatening other software developers to terminate the manufacture of middle-ware products. Microsoft Company was also under another investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice for violation of the antitrust laws. In this investigation, Microsoft was found to be unlawfully integrating windows and its browser program Internet explorer. The company was also found to be in an attempt to monopole the internet (Hepburn & Lopatka, 2007). The charges levied against Microsoft in all the above cases were valid. According to Hepburn and Lopatka (2007), Microsoft Company is not the leader in software manufacturing because of its innovative capability, but due to its prowess in taming competitors by use of unethical means. The company’s ability to block middle-ware products is a clear indication that the company fears competition especially in operating systems which is the company’s area of dominance. The company has also entered into agreements with other companies especially the ones that manufacture computer hardware such as Intel and IBM to make sure that most of the hardware produced in the market is customized to only use Microsoft products at the expense of its competitors. Another clear indication that Microsoft is going against the Sherman Act in the name of innovation is the integration of various products to its windows operating systems. For instance, Microsoft tied its internet browser, Internet Explorer only to use its operating systems with the aim of dominating the internet. The company inclusion of Java run time environment on its windows and writing programs that are windows-specific java version made the java programs not to function across other platforms. All this was done by the software giant with the aim of countering java software that was available across other platforms. The introduction of internet browser program Netscape navigator is another area of interest that brands Microsoft as a violator of Sherman Act. The introduction of Netscape navigator in 1994 made Microsoft to respond by introducing its own browser Internet explorer and distributing it free of charge which made Netscape navigator to give up its browser program. In conclusion, it is apparent that Microsoft Corporation has continued to violate antitrust laws commonly referred to as Sherman Act thus denying other businesses in the same market an opportunity to establish their products. It will be beneficial for the consumer and the general economy if the antitrust laws are enforced to enhance competition in the software manufacturing industry.

"The rules of chess are fairly simple. Each player has 16 pieces: a king, a queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The objective of the game is to checkmate the opposing king. To checkmate a king, the opposing pieces need to surround it in such a way that it cannot move without being captured. The game starts with each player's pieces in their respective positions on the board, and the player with the white pieces typically moves first. Players take turns making moves with their pieces in an effort to gain an advantage and ultimately checkmate the opponent. Pieces move according to their own specific rules, and captures are made either by occupying the space of an opposing piece or by taking it with a knight or pawn. The game ends when one player checkmates the other, or when a draw is declared by mutual agreement or lack of legal moves.",1,ai

"The Supreme Court has unanimously cleared the way for two of the biggest patent-assertion cases in recent years. The justices on Tuesday said a challenge by Google, Inc. to Amazon.com Inc.'s patents isn't ripe for review, but have said the same patents that give Apple's iPhone and iPad a competitive edge should be challenged. The court's action means the court will hear more Apple and Microsoft patents cases from 2012, when they lost in patent-holding companies such as Oracle Corp., as it deals with several other high-profile patents that can't easily be challenged. The companies, however, will be able to petition higher courts for permission to challenge a patent. The companies want the issue to take up in the high-profile appeals courts in California, where Google had asked for an appeal. Apple and Microsoft say the high-stakes patent question deserves a hearing in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, where the patent owners, including Microsoft and Apple, are represented. However, the Federal Circuit doesn't have to take up the case. The court's action is ""another example of this Court turning its head and standing on its heels while other high courts around the nation, including the Ninth Circuit and others, have taken these questions on,"" Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith has said. The court left intact two lawsuits against Google, including one in which Google had sued Amazon and Microsoft for patent infringement on the principle of a ""listening service."" The appeals court has set aside a separate case involving Google that involved its use of patents in Android to protect its own Android mobile operating system, not other software, as the two companies had challenged. This means Google can continue to use the patents to challenge Amazon and Microsoft to challenge Apple and Microsoft. The Supreme Court in a separate decision had also cleared the way for an appeals court to hear a case involving patents owned by Google.",1,ai

"In an effort to bolster the morale of the country's public transport system in the run-up to the upcoming general election, officials are proposing an additional 15 million Swiss francs ($15 million) in rail funding. The funds will be used to implement new maintenance measures, expand the network and modernize the trains' power systems, according to the Local. ""The budget does not allow for all we need, as we aim to upgrade and modernize the infrastructure immediately,"" said Christoph Mittermayer, who heads the Swiss Federal Rail Transportation Commission. ""We want to put a lot more money into things like the maintenance of the trains, the maintenance of the infrastructure and the modernization of the infrastructure,"" he told the news agency. The commission is expecting to approve three projects that cover a total of 15 million. The biggest project is supposed to improve power reliability for trains across the country by adding 300 kW of electricity at some of the key stations. Officials are also considering a plan to increase the length of train stations by 30 meter-long stretches, and upgrade some of the oldest ones to help keep the railways clean. A third project proposes to increase the speeds of trains to up to 220 km-per-hour, which would translate to an average speed of 70 km/h at the busiest stations. ""Our priority is to make sure we reach the minimum number required in all the projects on the table,"" Mittermayer added.",1,ai
"Golf clubs are a key component to your personal game planning. They can take your game to the next level by making accurate putts. This course will offer you a unique challenge thanks to the undulating green. In the first tee area, you can expect sand and rocks, but the second one is wooded with an assortment of trees and brush. The tee pad is a fairway. As in all good course planning, be strategic at the start of rounds. The layout plays as a par-72, so make adjustments and adjust for the wind. If you're up and down on a fairway, you have to expect that there will be some greenside obstacles – particularly if it plays like the course does (the most common scenario), or if you put in the extra effort and shoot the perfect shot. What makes this course unique is its unique terrain. It has three different tee pads and many putts – each of which needs to be placed perfectly, in such a way to ensure that shots can actually end on each one. As with most courses, there are a couple of hazards. For those with a fear of heights, you'll not be thrilled. On the other hand, if you're willing to face them, you'll find a challenging course here. The back tees have some elevation change around them – and if you hit them from the wrong angle, you could find yourself standing on something. But the main issue with this golf course is that it's the kind of course that you can practice a ton – it's a challenging but fun type of golf that you don't have to try very much. The terrain is also fairly forgiving.",1,ai
"World Basketball Legend: Stephen Curry Essay Sport is an essential part of the life of any modern person. Some people devote themselves entirely to sports, attending daily workouts and exercising diligently. Others like to observe the results achieved by athletes only. Among other kinds of sports, basketball is still one of the most popular today. According to Sport Science, Curry has the fastest shot, with Golden State point guard jumping and releasing the ball in just 4 seconds (Moussavi and Nugent 7). A world-famous basketball player, Stephen Curry, can rightfully be called a basketball legend. This striking athlete, number 30, gives all his best for the good of his team. Being an extraordinary person, he often finds himself on the front pages of fashion magazines. That is because, along with his remarkable sports potential, this outstanding individual is of interest to the public as a charismatic and unpredictable person. The future star of the Golden State Warrior’s first line-up continues the sporting dynasty. World basketball legend Stephen Curry was born in the small American town of Akron, Ohio, into a close-knit family. Stephen’s father, Dell, was seriously fond of various sports, but most of all, basketball (Canfield and Long 3). He now works as a sports commentator and often comments on games with his son. It could be said that his father, Dell Curry, instilled a love of basketball in his children (Aretha 37). He played for the Charlotte Hornett team for about ten years and often took Steph and his younger brother Seth to his games. At the same time, Stephen’s mother, Sonya, was not new to sports: she played for a volleyball team at the Polytechnic University of Virginia (Porterfield 147). As for Seth Curry, he played for the Golden State Warriors in the 2013–2014 season. Thus, one can see that the whole family of the famous basketball player is very close to sports. From 2006-2009, Steph played for the team at Davidson College, where he studied. In 2008, he was included in the second symbolic team of the best players in the US Student Championship, and in 2009 Curry played in the first team (Siemienowicz 32). After three seasons in college, Stephen decided to become a professional basketball player and skipped his final year. As a result, in the 2009 NBA Draft, he was selected at number 7 by the Golden State Warriors (Thompson 127). Stephen Curry remains the club’s leading point guard to this day. The season from 2015 to 2016 brought fantastic luck to the talented player; he set an NBA record, becoming the champion of all times and people (Moussavi and Nugent 17). These are not just big words: no basketball player has yet managed to win 73 matches in one season. Stephen’s dream to prove that he took his place for a reason came true to the world and himself. American professional basketball player Stephen Curry is playing for the NBA Golden State Warriors. He was named the most significant player in the NBA twice, and in the 2015-2016 season, all participants voted for him. It was the first time in the history of the association. Curry has scored decisive shots or thrown incredible three-pointers with siren numerous times throughout his NBA career. Being one of the best players, Stefan Kari never ceases to amaze people with his achievements and demonstrates excellent play. Works Cited Aretha, David. Lebron vs. Durant vs. Curry vs. Jordan .

"In this image published by the Iraqi Press Agency, a member of an Iraqi paramilitary force, stands at what is described in the media as the Mosul Dam, on September 5, 2014. Iraqi forces pushed their assault on the Islamic State group near the city of Mosul on Tuesday evening. AFP PHOTO / MOHAMMED AL-SUDANI (Photo credit should read MOHAMMED AL-SUDANI/AFP/Getty Images) It is no secret that ISIS has been wreaking havoc in the Middle East. However, the Islamic terrorist group is also taking a new approach in Syria. They are employing children as soldiers to help the fighting, according to an article published by the Guardian. According to the article, the U.S. Department of State's Child Soldiers Prevention Initiative identified the ISIS's use of children to fight as a ""serious humanitarian crisis"" back in 2011. Many of these children are only nine years old. The story is not new, but it is noteworthy for its focus on the terrorist organization. In the U.S., some lawmakers, including Florida Senator Marco Rubio, have criticized the Trump administration for supporting ISIS. The report claims that some children have been put to death and others used as suicide bombers. On Wednesday the Guardian published a report about a nine year old, Mohammad, and his two best friends, both children of Iraqi politicians. The boys have been recruited as suicide bombers for ISIS. The boys have been indoctrinated to follow the terrorist organization's rules. According to the report, Mohammad has been trained in the use of suicide techniques by a religious police member in Mosul. Once he receives an official order, he is then asked to carry out a suicide attack in northern Iraq. He then returns to Mosul in order to carry out his mission. Mohammad's parents are in Iraq, but the boys' father is in Syria. Mohammad, his friend, and the others must continue with their training and training at a secret school on the outskirts of Raqqa. On a recent visit to Raqqa, Mohammad gave an extremely detailed account of how he trains. In an interview he said, ""I was in Syria two years as a child and three months as a boy. I participated every night in prayers, all of Friday prayers, and after the Friday prayer, I went to the mosque in Raqqa to listen to the sermon of ISIS's holy sheikh Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi."" The report states, ""Mohammad was trained for three full months to prepare for his mission. The training sessions were conducted in a school compound and took place in two different houses. In the first house, in which he lived with his father, he had a computer with a DVD player and the latest videos. On one of these videos, he saw his friends being captured by Islamic State fighters, who were all wearing black."" The other house was used by a senior leader and his wife for training, according to the report. Mohammad told the Guardian, ""I was in the second house with my friends and we heard from the senior leader about three days before the martyrdom training. His family came to the house and the commander's wife sat next to me. She wanted to know what would happen in the future and she asked me how I would spend the rest of my days."" On a subsequent day, Mohammad said, ""We were given the choice between being executed, or being given training. If we were found to be disloyal, we were executed. If we didn't choose any of these choices, all the training would be the same: when they wanted to teach us to use a different weapon or different means to achieve a target, we were to hit them without mercy."" ISIS has already sent thousands of children to commit suicide operations in Syria and Iraq. The report claims that one such child, named Mahmoud, died on June 1, 2016, while he was carrying out his mission. Another child, also named Mahmoud, was able to survive in Syria, but was recently killed by a U.S. airstrike. ISIS used boys for suicide attacks in 2014, but it seems these acts took a new direction in 2016, according to the report. While the Islamic terrorist group uses children in Syria, American special operations forces have also been using U.S. Military advisors to teach Syrian militants how to fight. Those advisors are only in training and are not fighting. The report highlights this fact, but does not have an article specifically focusing on them. While it is known that Syrian militants and Al Qaida fighters are both using children, the U.S. Defense Department is known to have known of this practice for several years. The Washington Times reported in 2009 that the United States and its allies were training and equipping Syrian rebels, in part, to take care of ISIS and Al Qaida in the future. After months of training, U.S. troops came into the fight and killed a number of militants.",1,ai

"Dennis and I have spent years creating the world we want. We have made things we would never think possible with our own hands, in our own homes. We have loved things as simple, as complicated, and especially as crazy as everything that we've never seen in real life. So maybe it's no surprise that we have no idea what to make for our next special occasion. Dennis has a friend who just got back from a cruise ship and she mentioned, ""This guy over there is the same guy from a cruise ship."" I thought that he had the wrong guy. He took me into the restaurant where I met the rest of the guys. We talked about our experiences while we were gone and how we spent it. I told him everything on top of the meal, and when it was done, he asked for my number. A few days later I get a text message on my phone. It was Dennis. ""I know that you wanted to talk, but I'm so busy I'm not even going to bother texting you back."" I was stunned. What the hell, am I dating this chick? Dennis then asked me all about my trip, my experiences, and our shared vacation in Costa Rica. He took my phone right back and didn't stop texting me, even when I was back in Atlanta, because he had the same idea and he was just being Dennis. The first couple days, he was just calling me out of the blue and getting me to tell him what happened in Costa Rica, when I just wasn't into it. After a while, he started having me send pictures of the food, and he took to asking me questions about all the great food. Finally, I texted him that it was time to stop texting me. That was when I realized that we had the same idea and we were both a part of it. I've known a few men who have been just that and I had a blast every time I was with them. Dennis has a great sense of humor and the first couple of times I met him, it was obvious that he was the funniest guy I had ever met. I couldn't resist laughing along with everything and I don't think he could have. As he was getting to know me better, he told me about some of the things that make him a unique guy. I liked the fact that he was just a decent human being who is open to new experiences but who is a great writer for it. He is the kind of guy who knows that some of your best times will be with whoever you're going on your first date with. Dennis is fun, funny, and has amazing taste in what he likes. Sometimes I don't think that people can have it both ways. We both know that in the long run, it's never going to work, but if you're having fun while you're at it, why not have a go at both extremes of it together? This wasn't a game for Dennis like it would be for me. You can read more about Dennis on his website. Dennis is a self-proclaimed ""Carnivore"" and he likes to live life eating meat. He's worked for companies with meat as their main product and they know he really likes meat. He also has a passion for making friends and having a conversation with anyone who makes him laugh. I guess my biggest tip to Dennis is that he's going to take the job that interests him and let the rest of the world be amazed by it while he enjoys his life! This might be a bit of a spoiler, but I had so much fun on our first date, I think it is better for everyone if I don't talk about it anymore! Dennis and I had no intention of going on a date again until one day when I thought: Maybe I'll have Dennis' baby one of these years! I don't think he would want my baby to be an abomination or something like that, and then he wouldn't want me to take care of it because ""that's a woman's job!"" So, we came up with the idea of having our baby one of these days and I started researching all types of medical issues it might have. I found that there are a lot of possible issues a baby might have. It is possible that if a woman doesn't get pregnant, it might have an impact on how the child develops. I knew that I wouldn't choose a doctor that I had a bad experience with, so we agreed on my doctor, Dr. Elizabeth Kline, an OB/GYN at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. When I went on the internet and looked for doctors with good reputations, Dr. Kline seemed like somebody who could do great work and she has a website of her own; it is called ""The Best Baby"" and she writes articles about how to think while you're pregnant and she's actually done a lot of research on this subject. Dr. Kline did a detailed examination of our baby and we were delighted",1,ai

"You'll have to read the entire post but to summarize the main point: I believe there is a ""natural"" increase in testosterone when you train because there is some sort of testosterone-mediated positive feedback loop at work. I don't have any specifics I could share about the ""loop"" but I do believe that it is a good idea to start stimulating testosterone levels in as early as possible after a session. This is a topic that has been debated at length, I believe because both my training partner & myself are on a strict ""no testosterone"" program. I can see how it gets people confused but I actually think both people are missing the point. What we're really talking about when we talk about testosterone isn't ""T"" or what's in your sweat. Instead, it's all of those other things the body is doing that are related to testosterone: Exercise. Muscle damage. Cardio. Nutrition. This also doesn't just apply to bodybuilders — the majority of athletes do all of these things. The difference is the time of the day, of training volume, etc… Now, to be sure there is an increase in testosterone. Why? There are lots of reasons. Testosterone builds and keeps muscle. It reduces muscle damage. It reduces cellular breakdown. It stimulates protein synthesis. But when it comes to strength training and hypertrophy… I just don't see any evidence that a natural ""increase"" in testosterone will have any sort of practical effect. Here's what I mean: In a study with elite women athletes, researchers looked at the correlation between serum LH & T levels. They found that as the level of testosterone in the females went up, the level of serum LH began a gradual, linear decline. The level peaked 2 weeks after the testosterone dose. During that time, no other hormonal or caloric interventions had any correlation with their T levels. They concluded that the drop in serum LH after the administration of testosterone had no effect on the increase in testosterone. That same study showed just the opposite effect for men: when testosterone levels rose, it increased the body's ability to recover from training. Now the point I'm driving at isn't that there is something wrong with the idea of a ""natural increase"" in testosterone. I don't feel this way. If I'm training for an event in which the goal is to build muscle faster, I'm going to want to do testosterone boosters like Clenbuterol & Orals, etc… I don't think they are necessary and I've found I actually can get better gains without them. But if you want to be the greatest bodybuilder, you need to be consistent with your diet, proper training, and nutrition. It isn't as simple as just ""doing it."" So what's the bottom line? I don't think you'll get any specific benefits from taking anything that increases your serum LH if this is your sole goal. If you want to have the strongest muscles in the world, you've got plenty of other places to focus your efforts, including strength training. What should you take?

"Calgary stopped adding fluoride to its water supply in 2011 but that doesn't mean the fluid from your faucet is fluoride-free. Naturally occurring fluoride is still present in the city's drinking water at levels ranging from about one-tenth to one-third the amount found prior to council's decision to stop artificial fluoridation. Regular testing of Calgary's treated water in 2014 found fluoride levels between 0.08 and 0.26 milligrams per litre. John Jagorinec, the city's water treatment manager, said he's seen levels as high as 0.4 milligrams per litre since 2011. Cities that still add fluoride to their water typically aim for a level of 0.7 milligrams per litre in order to improve dental health among the populations they serve. Levels of naturally occurring elements found in Calgary's treated drinking water in 2014. Minimum and maximum values are shown from regular tests conducted throughout the year. (City of Calgary data/CBC image) The naturally occurring fluoride in Calgary's water originates from erosion of rock and soil in the watersheds that supply the city. Jagorinec said natural fluoride levels tend to be slightly higher in water from the Elbow River as compared to the Bow River, and usually the concentrations are highest in the winter, when flow levels are at their lowest. These amounts of fluoride are well within provincial and federal water-quality requirements, Jagorinec noted. The same goes for dozens of other elements that occur naturally in the environment and make their way into the water supply in tiny amounts, including metals such as potassium and barium. ""It's quite common to find these metals in all surface waters and in well waters,"" Jagorinec said. ""They just leach of out the natural environment."" Levels of particularly toxic heavy metals such as arsenic and mercury are also monitored in Calgary's water but, if they're present, they're found in quantities so minute — less than 0.00005 milligrams per litre — that they are effectively nil. ""We're looking down, in many cases, in the part-per-billion level — so, really tiny concentrations — but we're still unable to detect any,"" Jagorinec said. 'Optimal' fluoride level North American cities that add fluoride to their water typically aim for a concentration of about 0.7 milligrams per litre, which is considered to be an ""optimal"" level by most health authorities, including Health Canada and the Department of Health and Human Services in the United States, to protect dental health without adverse effects. Levels higher than that can lead to an increased chance of dental ​fluorosis, a condition that results in a change in the appearance of tooth enamel that occurs when children's developing teeth are exposed to excess amounts of fluoride. Some cities, including Calgary, have stopped their fluoridation programs based on concerns that fluoride has toxic effects on humans, but Health Canada says there is no evidence of that when drinking water levels are kept below 1.5 milligrams per litre. ""The weight of evidence from all currently available studies . also does not support a link between fluoride exposure and intelligence quotient deficit, as there are significant concerns regarding the relevant studies, including quality, credibility, and methodological weaknesses,"" Health Canada states. Study of Chinese children One paper often cited by critics of fluoridation came from researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health, who conducted a meta-analysis of dozens of studies of children in China who were consuming drinking water with naturally occurring fluoride levels as high as 11.5 milligrams per litre. The researchers found ""children in high-fluoride areas had significantly lower IQ scores than those who lived in low-fluoride areas."" After publishing their initial results, the researchers issued a special statement noting some of the groundwater fluoride levels in China ""greatly exceeded levels that are typical in the U.S."" ""These results do not allow us to make any judgment regarding possible levels of risk at levels of exposure typical for water fluoridation in the U.S.,"" the statement reads. ""On the other hand, neither can it be concluded that no risk is present."" One of the researchers later called on U.S. cities, some of which still fluoridate their drinking water to levels of 1.0 to 1.2 milligrams per litre based on older recommendations, to reduce that concentration to 0.7 milligrams per litre. Resume fluoridation in Calgary? For Dr. Richard Musto, medical officer of health for Alberta Health Services' Calgary zone, there is no doubt that fluoride at Health Canada's recommended levels would be beneficial to the population, as a whole. He believes city council should re-examine its decision to stop",0,human

"Expos 20 Writing Course by Harvard University Essay Harvard University introduces expos 20 as an essential writing course included in the Harvard College Writing Program that suggests insight into expository writing (“Expos 20”). This course is rather useful due to the elements involved in it and various objectives. Expos 20 presents a fantastic opportunity to develop one’s writing skills and improve the mastery of building and defending an argument, searching and evaluating academic sources, crafting a thesis and suggesting analytical questions, and many other necessary options. There are several major objectives predetermined by this course. The main thing is that the philosophy of Expos 20 views writing as indivisible from thinking, and good thinking requires perfect writing skills (“Expos 20”). This philosophy outlines the main aim of the course – to teach students how to express their thoughts in perfectly developed writing. What is particularly positive about Expos is that students are not required to have any previous experience regarding the courses’ topics. Such a position gives a possibility to any student to participate in the course that he or she chooses without worrying that they might not catch up with their peers. Moreover, during the course, each learner has as much personal attention from the instructor as he or she needs. Thus, the absence of background is not a problem. Another positive idea about Expos 20 is that although there are some required texts, each course also suggests some freedom of choosing the reading material. It is so due to Expos being oriented on the final goal of teaching students the strategies of academic writing. The choice of reading material, thus, may be partially made by each student personally. The main idea is that readings, whichever the students choose, should develop their writing skills. Expos 20 is a rather intensive course. It involves a great range of tasks and activities. For example, students learn the basics of gathering evidence, using and citing sources, and avoiding plagiarism. At Expos 20 , students are given a diversity of tasks and topics. By allowing such an opportunity, instructors enable every student to find his or her strongest feature and develop that skill throughout the course. One more great thing about Expos is that at each stage, students receive a lot of feedback from their instructors. Thus, if a learner fails to understand some important issues, the misunderstanding will be dismissed at the very early stage, and he or she will proceed with the course without any lengthy pauses. Short papers undergo several revisions, which is also rather advantageous as students have a chance to see their typical errors so that they could avoid them in the future. Class discussions of learners’ papers help to see the general tendencies of peers and evaluate one’s achievements in comparison with others. The ultimate goal of Expo 20 is to develop students’ expository writing skills and teach them “to be his or her own best (severest) critic” (“Expos 20”). To reach this aim, many productive methods are employed. Students may feel some pressure at the beginning, but if they attend the classes regularly and cope with every task, they will become proficient in academic writing. The integration of writing and thinking, as dictated by Expo ‘s philosophy, gives learners a wide range of opportunities in their studies as well as in their future profession. Therefore, the course is a great way of developing and enhancing one’s expositional writing skills in an intensive learning atmosphere with a variety of assignments and evaluation methods.

"The number of Syrian refugees resettled in the United States since President Donald Trump's executive order to temporarily halt migration has reportedly tripled. Trump signed an executive order on Friday prohibiting citizens of seven Islamic-majority countries from entering the United States for the next 90 days. According to the White House, the new restriction targets Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, which are all majority Muslim. A White House official told The Associated Press that the order had reduced the number of refugees to 50,000 in the US since Trump came to power, down from 110,000 in fiscal year 2017 and the 110,000 figure set for 2018. The official also confirmed an early CNN report that the number of Syrians would double, after the Syrian refugee issue was placed on a three-month halt by the Obama administration during the previous administration. The order states that US authorities ""may not admit any refugee in any form."" It did not explain the meaning of that phrase. An immigrant who has fled the war-torn country because of the civil war was detained at JFK airport and told he could be sent to prison for as long as seven years, if a judge did not put him on a travel ban, according to a lawyer for the man. Ibrahim Hooper, a refugee, was detained for hours while immigration officials questioned him following Trump's announcement that was set to put a temporary ban on refugees after receiving a request for a ban from Trump, according to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Speaking to the AP on Sunday, Hooper said he was handcuffed, beaten and threatened with deportation, which would have seen him sent to Haiti.

The executive order signed by Trump, which included Iraq, was slammed across the country, with many saying it would hurt the US economy. The Trump administration said the order would help US nationals, whose passports have been issued by US diplomatic missions to those countries, during the period of the ban from traveling to the US. But advocates said that the order was unnecessary and it could stop children, refugees and immigrants from the US. It was reported by CNN that more than 90,000 people from the seven countries listed in the executive order had applied for asylum or withholding of removal from the United States during the first three days of the first week, the US official informed the news agency.",1,ai
"In March 2014, Google announced that it would no longer provide a free online storage service. Since Google Docs was just a small part of the search giant's overall suite of products, the announcement caused some consternation for some in the business. As Google explained at the time, there were still reasons for many people to use Google Docs, particularly for a single person or an entity that required high amounts of storage space, but at the same time Google said that this service had become too expensive and would be discontinued. So, while Google's entire cloud services (Gmail, Drive, Google+ and more) got new features such as syncing with your Android phone and the ability to share documents with other devices via the web, Google Docs was no longer for sale. Fast forward to January 2017 and it looks like other businesses that want cheap and flexible storage, or need to keep copies of documents created on other cloud services, may have a better option. Today Google finally announced that Google Drive 2.0 will be free for businesses. That could mean Google's drive storage service is becoming cheaper by 50 percent or so, but it could also mean that businesses no longer needed to worry about how much it would cost or what their budget was for online storage, since they no longer have to consider the expense during the entire design and development cycle. If business-focused web sites are any indication, it appears the decision will be made quickly. Here's a peek at what Google just released for business consumers: Google Drive 2.0 is a major step toward Google's objective of making its online services more accessible to businesses, in the form of free storage in its Google Drive products as well as a business-focused cloud products from the Google cloud. While many will likely still choose to use Google Docs for their own documents, at least it's a move that makes some sense. After all, if you're using them with no business content, it appears the cost of storing or maintaining documents there goes up. Still, business users with some business-focused content, such as emails written by the CEO of the company, will probably continue to have to pay for it anyway. The best decision may still be to not be a part of the Google cloud yet and stick with your own cloud storage solution.",1,ai
"As we wait to hear whether President Donald Trump will issue an executive order to ban transgender individuals from serving in the military, lawmakers are gearing up to push legislation that would prevent transgender people from enlisting in the U.S. military. Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-MO) introduced HR 4529, the ""No Taxpayer Funding for Transgender Discrimination Act of 2017"", on April 15. According to the bill's press release, ""The law would prohibit the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) from providing any federal funds to any employer, labor organization, or federal contractor which discriminates based on their gender identity, including the failure to include such discrimination in workplace policies or training."" ""When discrimination is illegal, good people can't fight back,"" Rep. Hartzler said in a press release. ""What happened to this country? It used to be a common-sense view that no one would be fired for being gay or straight, but today we're telling them that's not good enough. These are our brothers and sisters. The American people have always been a beacon of hope for each other, even when some didn't always agree with every choice they made. And no one should be denied their God-given rights based on their gender identity and sexual orientation."" Hartzler, of course, is no stranger to fighting for conservative causes. Most recently, he's been fighting against LGBT rights, opposing a law aimed at protecting LGBT employees. ""I am committed to ensuring that the policy of the Obama Administration is not applied to individuals serving our country,"" Hartzler explained to the Associated Press earlier this spring, according to Politico. ""I'm proud to reintroduce this legislation. We can't stand silent on this issue as we debate the proper role of our military."" As LGBT advocates continue to push for the repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell,"" a bill that sought to repeal the law in late 2010, Hartzler's proposal may give Republicans a new reason why they should vote for it. ""LGBT advocates, as well as gay-rights groups, have long cited the military's need for an equal force as one reason for supporting the repeal,"" the Washington Blade reported. ""This is the first proposal in the House to address that fact."" As Hartzler notes in the press release, ""The Department of Defense estimates that there are thousands of transgender individuals in the military who could be discharged for their gender identity."" That is likely the reason that the Department of Defense hasn't yet begun openly accepting transgender service members. While the bill doesn't mention which branches of the military would be affected by the bill, the Department of Defense (DOD) is responsible for all branch-specific policies and regulations. So it seems likely that it would be the case that any policy affecting the services would ultimately be directed by the DOD. ""The transgender issue is extremely complex, and it is important for us to recognize the myriad of issues that may need to be dealt with before the Department of Defense makes further determinations about military service,"" DOD spokeswoman Dana White told the Blade. ""This is just not the time to take actions that would adversely affect our military readiness, which includes readiness for training, deployments and personnel."" On the other hand, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, said previously that the Pentagon could allow transgender individuals to enlist in the military if it deemed that the service was ""affirmative,"" according to a Washington Post report. This, of course, was before Trump announced in late July that the services were now free to decide for themselves. In a new interview, McCain, though, told CNN's Jake Tapper that he still plans on pushing for the Pentagon to rescind the ban on transgender members. ""I have not changed my view on that,"" he said. ""And I think we have to respect people's ability to serve, who are being trained, who are being ordered to war."" Though Trump has promised his Defense Department won't let transgender people into the armed forces, he has made it clear that he doesn't support transgender people serving in the military.",1,ai

"Wednesday, October 31, 2012 Dismantling a whole fresh 110 pounds Bigeye Tuna Just got back from Benoa unloading my boat. Export all AA grade to Japan and decided to bring one home too. Usually I will earn range of USD $14-22 dollar per kg. So I only take A grade home or grade B. This time I wanted to eat the best quality from my boat. I instruct the checker to choose the best of the best. The one that will sell 22 USD per kg, so I took my 1000 USD fish home. The fish was oily and had a little fat so it is perfect for me. 110 pound fresh Bigeye tuna next to my son. To start the cutting process, sharpen the knives. you will need a very sharp knives! It will save you a lot of time and it helps you cut through the fish clean. You need a big ziplock bags, 4 big bowl preferably aluminium or plastic. Cut the side starting from the tail working all the way to the front. Make sure u feel the bottom of knive sliding through the bone. Then cut through the middle part of the tuna all the way to the tail. That will be you first loin Divide the loin into 3 parts, for steaks and saku for sashimi on the left is steak cuts and on the right saku cut (middle part of the loin) Cut the other side same method with first loin o -toro do not stack the steak together After you finish cutting the tuna into loins, you will have many small pieces cut into cube and keep in one bowl. Tuna cube os best serve for paleala, tuna salad or sandwhich. The Tuna meat from bone and skin, minced finely and keep it in another bowl. This you can make amazing Tuna burger for the kids. The next chop all the bone to 15 cm width and keep it for fish soup, stock and broth. The tuna head take out the eye and cheek is best cook with terayki sauce. the remaining of the head cut into 15 cm width also for the fish soup, fish stock, or fish broth. The loin you cut into different part like below in the diagram. For sashimi i usually use middle part of the meat and chu- toro. The rest is for steak. The skin you can deep fried to make tuna crackers. These fish are amazing creature, respect them and use everything meat they have to offer. nothing goes to waste! You will be surprise how good some of the parts that you used to throw away. Sadly these fish are being over fish here in Indonesia, i have been struggling trying to promote sustainable fishing in Bali, but it seem to be an ongoing fight.

"When it comes to the Internet of Things, companies are often forced to choose between a number of competing technologies. In the case of Microsoft, the software giant took a cautious stance early on, announcing its intention to ""partner and co-develop"" connected machines with companies, including Samsung. But later on, Microsoft moved to adopt the open standard of the IoT Alliance—the organization of which Samsung is a member. But what does that means for consumers? Is it better to just stick with Microsoft, or is there some other choice to consider, like the likes of Samsung, Apple and Huawei? As it turns out, there's quite a bit to consider.

"The fourth of six kids, Patrick McCaw learned young the merits of observation. Much of his early years growing up in St. Louis were spent waiting to get a word in. ""With three older siblings, he understands you have to listen,"" said Jeff McCaw, Patrick's father. It is that patient, even-keeled approach that has earned Patrick the nickname among his Warriors teammates of ""P Nice."" The problem? In deferring to others, McCaw sometimes hurts the team. Golden State is at its best when he is making the most of the spacing his All-Star teammates afford. By that measure, McCaw has made important strides this week. Head coach Steve Kerr has encouraged him for months to be more aggressive looking for his shot. After averaging 3.1 attempts over his first 29 games of the season, McCaw has totaled 20 shots over his past two. In Wednesday night's 126-101 win over Utah, he forced the defense to stop sagging off him. McCaw scored a season-high 18 points, including 12 in the second half, on 7-for-10 shooting. The highlight came late in the third quarter, when he caught a pass from Jordan Bell on the left elbow, saw a wide-open driving lane, took one hard dribble and hit the layup while taking contact. As McCaw walked to the foul line, teammate Draymond Green erupted off the bench and unleashed a roar. Green, who has long stressed to McCaw the importance of being aggressive, recognized that McCaw would likely have passed up that layup earlier in the season. ""He's a defender primarily, in his own mind, and a distributor,"" Kerr said of McCaw. ""Scoring is sort of a secondary thought for him. We are trying to get him as aggressive as possible. He plays his best when he is looking to score, like he did tonight."" McCaw learned early from Jeff, a longtime high school basketball coach in the St. Louis area, to let plays develop before deciding whether to pass or shoot. In eighth grade, while many of his peers mimicked Kobe Bryant's pump fake or Allen Iverson's crossover, McCaw worked regularly with his dad and a promising junior, Ben McLemore — now a guard for the Memphis Grizzlies — on his footwork at the now-shuttered Wellston High School outside St. Louis. It was McCaw's old-school playing style that compelled Golden State to buy his rights — the No. 38 pick of the 2016 NBA draft out of UNLV — from the Milwaukee Bucks for $2.4 million. As a rookie last season, he carved out a rotation spot by playing with a poise that belied his inexperience. A roster stocked with household names freed McCaw to play solid defense, set screens and find open teammates in the flow of the offense. Two of his best performances came in the playoffs. In Game 3 of Golden State's first-round sweep of Portland, McCaw had 11 points on 4-for-6 shooting with five rebounds and five assists. Three weeks later, in Game 2 of the Western Conference finals against San Antonio, he had 18 points, five assists, three rebounds and three steals in 27 minutes. It was enough for many to assume he wouldn't play in Summer League for a second straight year. By his choice, McCaw headed to Las Vegas in July and outplayed some of the 2017 draft's top picks, averaging 20 points, 3.2 rebounds and 2.6 assists in five games. The offseason additions of Nick Young and Omri Casspi made it tricky for him to build off his surprisingly productive rookie season. Now, after yo-yoing in and out of the rotation for two-plus months, McCaw has averaged 24.3 minutes the past 10 games with Stephen Curry out with a sprained right ankle. Hyper-aware that he shares a court with some of league's best scorers, McCaw has had a tough time deciphering when to pass and when to shoot. His driving lanes have become so open recently that Green, Kerr, Kevin Durant and others have empowered him to take what the defense gives him. ""To have the opportunity to play with them and just find my niche with this team, I think it's been the biggest step for me,"" McCaw said. ""When you have guys like Klay (Thompson) and KD telling you to go out there and have fun and play aggressive, I think it's starting to help me out a lot more.""

"The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released a report that describes how the U.S. government has been ""unable to obtain and analyze accurate information"" from the National Security Agency (NSA). To make matters worse, the agency is unable to share it with the public. The New York Times reports, on Sunday: ""The N.S.A.'s inability to produce accurate information about what it has collected from American telecommunications companies, and about the government's programs to do so, have undermined confidence in the agency and put innocent Americans' private information at risk of attack by terrorists, according to classified accounts of classified meetings and agency briefings provided to The New York Times."" The study, entitled ""Understanding the N.S.A.'s Mission,"" says the documents were acquired in 2013 via an unnamed source. The NIST says the documents are ""extremely valuable,"" as they were first released during the George W. Bush administration and have ""changed perceptions about the N.S.A.'s mission and capabilities."" It adds that, while there is no indication the reports were released to ""deliberate deception"" in public, and that there is no evidence of ""unauthorized disclosure,"" they have ""concern about how N.S.A. employees and contractors have handled and used the material."" The Obama administration issued a statement of defense in response to the NIST report. ""Our government has had a close working relationship with the NSA, and all our laws, policies and protocols with regard to government surveillance have kept us all safe,"" a spokesman told the BBC. ""These documents show that government secrecy rules are being broken, and we will take enforcement action."" The spokesman also said that the ""government, Congress and the American people have had extensive conversations about these issues, and this administration takes its efforts to ensure information is handled in a way that protects national security seriously and is accountable."" The Times notes that the Obama administration is the first to have responded on record to the report, which is now under investigation by the independent Office of the Inspector General (OIG) at the Department of Justice, as well as several other agencies. Congressional investigations are now under way to shed new light on the extent to which U.S. intelligence officials inappropriately shared classified information with foreign governments prior to or after the 9/11 attacks. The revelations come as the president is trying to negotiate a new transatlantic free trade agreement, the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), with Canada ahead of the EU-Canada deal. As the new report on the impact of government data collection on the public debate over surveillance and privacy will reveal, the NIST investigation raises serious questions about the extent to which the Obama administration and its allies in Congress are trying to avoid any future investigations into the extent to which surveillance has been abused.

"If you were in the US last month, you might remember seeing a documentary about how we need to make sure our children grow up, eat healthy, and have access to a quality education. You might even remember the film's title. If you weren't at that event, then you might be seeing a very different message now. This might be the documentary you saw last month. According to the trailer, it looks like the US government is secretly attempting to replace teachers to create a generation of obedient workers, which is why these movies (and the other propaganda films like them) exist. One way or another, it also looks like we'll be watching more and more propaganda. It's no surprise, then, that some people are getting upset. The documentary, which was produced by the Institute of Noetic Sciences, was produced under the premise that the best way to teach our kids is to make sure they're doing something they're great at. This is basically what's called a self-fulfilling prophecy, but here's why they think it's effective: ""If children never learn anything, then society will never allow for any changes. And if society never allows for change, then children will never experience the changes necessary for any sort of innovation and development."" So we want to have the same children every year, and they'll never develop what it takes to be a fully functioning adult. What will they be good at? We can't teach them how to do anything, because if we do that, if they're not doing it, we'll never do it, and the world will collapse. A child who's incapable of working at all will never be motivated to work. That's because children have zero intrinsic motivation. Without motivation, they'll be a burden, not an asset; without an asset, they'll not be productive; and without productive, they'll not be productive, and so on. So we have to stop having kids, because otherwise children will never accomplish anything. And once they do accomplish something, they won't want to do anything else, because they've already done that. And this is the point that should really concern you. Parents often try to stop having kids because they think it'll stop them from working; a lot of them also try to do so because they think that it'll stop them from going to school. Well, the film takes both of these ideas and throws them to the winds. It's not the kids who are at fault. The kids are the product of their time in this world. Parents may be able to be part of their lives by letting them live in their world and by showing them and letting them experience the world around them. They can also be part of their worlds by teaching them that their world is good and valuable, and that they should strive to build a good world for our kids in return. Well, you can't stop everything, and you can't stop something that's supposed to be your job. And as much as many people may hate this, there is a good reason for it. As we've covered previously, you cannot stop people from doing what you want them to do. But there is a way to help the people you put in charge of things. That's why we have schools. The key word there is help. You may not be comfortable giving a child a book so that it makes them feel valued. That's fine—the book shouldn't matter—but you'll help by showing them how important it is. You'll help them see a positive example that they can emulate. You'll help them see that it's possible for them to be something great. And as much as it seems you don't, you can. We're all capable of greatness. The more we see people like that, the lower their self-esteem will be and the higher their self-worth will be. This is the message that we need to get out: children are capable of greatness, and you can help create this for them. To be clear, this is not an excuse for parents to ignore their responsibility in this regard. We're not advocating that people who come from homes with problems like yours do nothing and leave their children with their problems. No, that would likely create even worse problems. All we're saying is that the best way to help children with their difficulties is to do what you can to help them find alternatives to the ones they currently have. You can help make sure that your children are not the sort of people you'd like them to be. You can keep their hearts healthy—it's possible to do this and stay emotionally healthy in the process without abandoning your children completely, which some parents certainly do. And you can do the things you can as a parent that will lead to a more fulfilling and fulfilling life for them, that will develop them into self-reliant individuals. You can help them see that they're capable of achieving anything, and then help them do it",1,ai
"If you're the kind of person that wants to see the inside of that mysterious room at the front of the house, be prepared to wait: It's closed up. But the owners said they've taken good care of the house over the years because they would rather it be left to decay than be remodelled. The home was built in 1909 in Pigeon Forge. It's on the National Register of Historic Places, but for more than a decade, it was closed up due to renovations, the property's owner said. ""It's just too much to see the house and be the first person to get in there,"" said Tony Troup, chairman of the Pigeon Forge Development Commission. ""It's so private."" ""It was in fairly good shape, but it had some structural issues that needed a lot of attention,"" said Alan Ewing, who bought the home for $500,000 in 1992. ""I could see it from there."" Ewing had been searching for land for more than ten years, but the land wasn't available until now. His wife, Susan Ewing, who is now the seller of the property, has lived in the town of about 5,000 about six months, according to county records. She did not return a call from USA TODAY, and Troup declined further comment. The home, which has no exterior walls and is covered with glass and metal frames, is built in the Italian Baroque style in one of the town's most distinctive styles (known as ""porpoise"" homes), Troup said. It has six bedrooms and five and a half bathrooms, including a small swimming pool. The walls and windows are coated with wood paneling instead of brick for the look, and the home's exterior walls were covered with stained glass as part of the restoration, Ewing said. After renovations, the home lost about 20 to 25 per cent of its original size; it sits on 5,400 square feet, with no interior walls, according to a listing at the Stokes County Heritage Center in Pigeon Forge. Ewing said he didn't know exactly how much was saved, but estimated the cost of the renovation as between $40,000 and $50,000. When they first bought the home in 1991, the couple lived in a nearby townhouse and decided to rebuild the house, which was originally built in 1905. The home was built around a corner from the house the couple were living in. The couple sold the townhouse in 1999 to the late Bill Johnson, a Baptist minister, who had lived there with his wife, Janet Johnson, who died in 2004. Johnson died in 2007. The Ewing's renovated the home about 5 years ago, with additions including a new kitchen and bathroom, and the two-car garage. They also added a guest suite and an outhouse, according to the listing. Troup and Ewing purchased the home in 2011 and restored it in time for the home's designation on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2012, the Ewings added a second bedroom, a parlor and patio and the master bath. In addition, they added a large walk-in closet, which they converted into a wine and coffee store. In 2008, the couple's son, Michael Ewing Jr., died while visiting from Tennessee and his death didn't affect the work he and his dad had done, said Susan Ewing, who is the couple's granddaughter. Michael Jr. purchased the home in the late 1970s. In October, the Ewings had the house restored by a local glassblowing business, said Ewing. After the remodel, the house had about $2 million in work done, he said. The home is ""pretty darned comfortable,"" he said. ""It was a lot of work."" But it's a home, and it is something the Ewing family has always wanted, he said. ""We're just looking to see other people appreciate it,"" he said. ""We've really done our best to preserve it.""

"The following is an excerpt from a speech by Dr. Bernard Nathanson, in London, on May 23, 2014. Nathanson, who has been a prominent American atheist for decades, discussed the role religion should play in the public discussion on climate change; the role of religion and belief in the scientific method; and the secularization of society. The second half of Dr. Nathanson's speech was posted to YouTube, and can be found here. The first time I ever heard about the science on climate change, it occurred in a school meeting where a young man presented an interesting theory, which I'll call ""the temperature war."" That's quite a mouthful, but basically it states that the hottest parts of the globe are already hot now, that they will get hotter as the ice melts around them, and that they will also increase in intensity and frequency. So the question of the day is, why aren't we warming up and cooling down now? The answer is straightforward: we have no control over it. You can say we should do something about it, but there's not much the U.S. government can do. The only thing we can do is to prepare for its worst effects. If we want to survive that future, then we must do our own best to prepare. Here's a quick example: the ice caps are melting. Now, we know there are some glaciers in Greenland that are melting, that will put pressure on those already melting glaciers. But what you have to do now is to get your kids and neighbors to put their roofs and windows on. We can't depend on the local authorities and big corporations to make that happen. We have to do it ourselves. That might mean finding ways around doors that are locked because of snow, for heating in old houses, etcetera. You have to start preparing now. You don't wait until you're forced to do it. That will never happen. It's a self-help project. If you want to make a long story short, I just want to make one statement of fact. No matter how bad the effects of warming may be, it will still be possible to have a safe, clean, climate-respecting climate-change regime for the coming centuries. So it has nothing to do with religion; it has nothing to do with whether you're a human being or a god. I can't speak for my fellow atheists. I would be surprised if they don't realize that. But if you think about it, then it's a reasonable conclusion and not at all surprising, that at least one of the reasons to stop climate change would be to save humanity from an extinction-level event. If that were the case, then the question isn't ""Can we stop climate change?"" The question is ""Can we preserve a civilization which supports a future for humans and other organisms, without this saving humanity from extinction?"" Religion is not about saving humanity. It's not even about preventing the disaster. It's about providing the tools. Science is the tool. You can have all the arguments you like about what's a good reason to have a religion, but you can't get rid of the science. If you don't have a science of climate change, then you don't understand how it's going to play out. If you want that science, you need a science of climate change. And that will only come with time. But there's a question of how long that science lasts. In the history of humanity, about the last 500 years, a succession of revolutions happened. A new religion came in, a new doctrine of freedom came in, a new language of human rights came in, a new conception of property rights came in. The Enlightenment happened, the Age of Reason came in, science and progress happened. The religion has faded away; the doctrine is replaced by a doctrine of personal freedom. And this idea of personal freedom is also present in the religious doctrine that has survived. What I'm referring to are the old concepts of faith, conscience, and the like. Here it's quite clear that they're not compatible with science. Here's the famous Galileo question. The argument is, If you say a planet revolved around a fixed star, that makes sense in terms of a geocentric system, but it is completely contradicted by the fact that the Earth moves around the Sun. This is a contradiction inherent in the very definition of the concept of geocentricity. This was brought up and discussed, and in the face of Galileo's arguments that the Earth moves around the Sun, a great many religious thinkers said we can't ever know. But it was clear from the first centuries of Christianity that Christianity was incompatible with scientific knowledge. And this conflict is still there today. So now the conflict is between religions. This is one of the ways to understand what happened during the great religious conflicts of those centuries. They came down to this: whether you wanted to become a part of a Christian",1,ai

"Achieving Academic Excellence Essay Studying at college is much like studying at high school, except for the fact that most college students leave on campus and have to search for a part time job to pay for the tuition. This begs the question what makes college education so important to suffer the lack of free time and the pressure of academic life, mainly grades. Despite the intense and often challenging academic life, college education is priceless in terms of the skills in self directed learning that it helps develop and train. The ability to learn on one’s own and evolve as a professional starts not with learning a set of particular rules, but with changes in personality, and college education will help shape my personality greatly. In other words, studying at college will teach me how to be independent in my learning process and rather be wisely guided by my academic advisors than follow the instructions blindly. Education at college will teach me the reasons for boundaries, whether of academic or of any other type, to exist, and how to be creative within these boundaries. More to the point, college education will help me develop and shape the qualities that are required for the so-called “lifelong education” (Barros 119). Understanding the algorithms of the learning process after conducting researches at college will help me explore new areas and remember new information easier. Speaking of boundaries and the means to cross them, information seems to have become the major tool for achieving success in the XXI century. The people, who are capable of searching for data efficiently, acquiring and processing it fast, and use it for business purposes, have everything what is needed for economic and financial success in the information society that we live in nowadays. For example, noticing a certain niche in a specific market and taking it before everyone else does is what may bring a leader of a third-rate company to the top of the world’s most influential entrepreneurships. Seeing how a college provides ample opportunities for learning the basics of information location, acquisition, processing and use by providing students with academic assignments, college education is unbelievably valuable for people who care about their future, me being one of these people. The last, but definitely not the least, college education will teach me the art of communicating my ideas in a coherent and convincing manner. True, communication skills can be acquired not only in college, but also in daily conversations; however, the latter will not provide me with the skills that I strive for attaining, i.e., the ability to convey my ideas to a vis-à-vis flawlessly, convince the opponent about a particular issue, be a good listener by not simply keeping silence when someone else is talking, but also by showing that the speaker’s point of view has been understood and accepted as a viable and reasonable one, etc. (Prashini 46). Though these qualities can also be developed and trained by interacting with peers, I assume that college lectures, presentations and other activities involving direct communication between a student and a teacher will help me acquire important communication skills faster and train them in a much more efficient manner. College education is not the only path to one’s professional, academic and personal evolution. However, it doubtlessly provides the opportunities for acquiring the skills that will be used for becoming a successful leader and a lifelong learner. Thus, college education is an integral and essential part of my social life and future career.

"Tiny and fast, a few lines of Ruby code could handle hundreds of thousands of users By Tom Gullo ComputerWorld LAYTON, Utah -- A tiny, self-contained system was built from scratch inside of Microsoft's headquarters in just 14 weeks. But it can be used by software engineers to manage more than 200,000 users on a single PC -- all without a third-party IT management service or an IT department of its own. It's the latest proof of the power of Ruby, a dynamic, easy-to-learn scripting language that can solve many tasks in the business world without costing a penny. ""Ruby is the ideal tool to tackle these challenges,"" said Matt Choytov, general manager of cloud services at Microsoft. Microsoft, which made its first foray into ""cloud computing"" 10 years ago with Windows Server, created Active Server Pages as an in-house system to simplify web development, testing and deploys in production. The company now uses the service to manage all of its products across more than 200 servers. ""What we tried to do with Server Pages in the past was put our products in a way that it's easy. and a lot of times it has been successful,"" said John Fidrych, Windows Group program manager at Microsoft Active Server Pages is a ""self-contained"" operating system, built on top of Microsoft's Windows Server 2000 operating system. To help drive software engineers to the Ruby programming language, Microsoft created Active Server Pages -- a lightweight, self-contained server software package -- that's used to build the code needed for web applications, including web pages. ""It's a fairly low-profile program,"" said Choytov. ""It's lightweight, which is why you can start learning Ruby and learn to use it within seven to 10 days."" Ruby uses the popular scripting language Ruby and its built-in library of data types, to manage many of the tasks that IT IT does daily. For example, when your web programmer creates a web page, many tasks inside Ruby are already performed by the hosting provider, and in many cases the hosting providers are already providing content to the web page developer. However, the web page needs to be tested, the page needs to be deployed as intended, and so on. ""It's like all of those things on steroids,"" Fidrych said. The software engineering team at Microsoft, part of a large, software engineering team in Redmond, Wash., is in the process of changing ""everything"" that has to do with developing Web pages for the Windows operating system. There's lots of work ahead. There's a chance that most of this work will be done in the future on Windows Server 2012 Enterprise, Fidrych said. At this moment, the system works on Windows 8 and Windows Server 2008 R2. As I discovered in my work for Microsoft 10 years ago, Microsoft engineers use Ruby in the same way that computer repair technicians use it. They understand how to use it, and they know what to expect with the code they write. But Ruby makes it easy for someone with little engineering experience to do some of the more complex tasks, such as creating a web page. Microsoft also used the system to support an online community for a special project. The system was deployed to all Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2008 R2 servers as part of an overhaul to the service in spring 2009. ""We wanted the ability to have a small number of engineers in the field, so they could contribute,"" said Brian Hall, a general management systems engineer at Microsoft. ""So we were running a small-scale community environment that supported several dozen engineers. And we wanted them to collaborate with each other."" Hall's new team, which developed a set of Active Server Pages to automate the building and maintenance of new online software products, would typically manage 100 to 200 employees. Choytov hopes that many more users are coming to the Ruby-based system to build and maintain their own web applications. He believes that a few programmers may start building web applications with Ruby. ""I think as Ruby becomes more and more widely used, and as people start using it that way, then we're going to see the number of people running Windows get much higher,"" Choytov said.",1,ai

"This mod provides a simple way so that your character can receive the effects of any spell you have. This includes spells from any mod, as long as it includes spell effects.This file is compatible with The Ultimate Magicka and any other custom spells mods (i.e. the default spells and potions). It also should work with every mod that includes custom spells, such as The Ultimate Magicka, SkyRe, or SkyRe Rebalanced. To use this mod, you must use this mod along with SkyRe's SkyReSharedScripts, and also the SkyRe Rebalanced spells. There will be an incompatibility warning, though, if you use any SkyRe Rebalanced spells or SkyReReplaceable Soul Gems that overwrite the SkyReRebalanced ones.Use your favorite mod manager to install. You do not need an esp plugin. When you have installed this mod, simply drop my mod in your Data folder of your new mod, and then activate it by loading it after SkyReSharedScripts.If you are updating from older versions, uninstall and install, then activate SkyReRebalanced again after you have used it. You do not need to uninstall the older versions if you've installed this.The changes made by SkyReRebalanced does not take affect until you use a magic effect. So if you equip a new sword with lightning spell effects, you may notice the animation take longer than usual when you use a different spell. This is intentional, as the original spells are not modified as these were used by a weapon that has different effects.This mod does not require SkyReRebalanced or SkyReSharedScripts to work. It requires SkyReRebalanced, and you must use SkyReRebalanced's SkyReSharedScripts (not SkyReReplacedSoulGems or SkyReReplacedSoulGemsReplaced, because they overwrite the original SkyReSpells). It also needs a version of SkyRe Rebalanced that includes the spells that include effects. This can be found here , and you do not need to download an updated version.The best way to get this mod on your Skyrim installation are using the Nexus Mod Manager. Once you start SkyReRebalanced, the ""Load after"" option in the main menu will have a ""SkyReEquipped"" option. If that option is not selected, then it is always loaded next to SkyReSharedScripts. The easiest way to see this is to check the bottom of SkyReReplacedSoulGemsReplaced for an appropriate list of magic effect IDs.When you activate a spell using (or without using) SkyReRebalanced's SkyReSharedScripts, you will receive whatever spell effect is installed in the mod you have selected. There are some exceptions that I will go into, but they are not necessary. For more info, see comments about SkyReReplacedSoulGemsReplaced.SkyReDefaultItems.esp is automatically loaded before SkyReRebalanced loads. If you choose not to install SkyReDefaultItems, the SkyRe-specific plugins will be loaded first. However, when you use SkyReReDefaultItems.esp, then it will load SkyReRebalanced's SkyReSharedScripts and SkyReRebalanced's SkyReSharedScripts before them. If you don't want SkyReDefaultItems to be loaded by default (or if you have it up to date), you can use the ""NoSkyReDefaultItems"" option in SkyReReDefaultItems.esp. This will have it default to being loaded after it.If you are using the ""NoSkyReDefaultItems"" option in SkyReReDefaultItems.esp, but you will still want to use SkyReDefaultItems.esp, you have three options you have to use, which have to do with this mod's dependencies. You can remove the SkyReSharedScripts from SkyReRebalanced (and other mods) that use SkyReReDefaultItems, or you can add SkyReRebalanced.esp to SkyReDefaultItems (and other mods).You can also remove the SkyReDefaultItems.esp from SkyReDefaultItems.esp and re-install it, but then you'll have to uncheck the NoSkyReDefaultItems option. It doesn't matter which choice you use, the mod's default settings will be still loaded after SkyReRe leveled up, but that is ok. You can still use the ""NoSkyReDefaultItems"" option if you want to.I recommend not using this mod unless you plan on using SkyReReDefaultItems.esp. In that case, you should install SkyReDefaultItems.esp first using the ""NoSkyReDefaultItems"" option and leave the SkyReReItem-specific plugins last. If you do change your mind after installing SkyReReDefaultItems.esp, you can always delete SkyReReDefaultItems.esp and the SkyReReItem-specific plugins.Sky",1,ai

"SpaceX may have canceled its mission to Mars with a Red Dragon capsule that was set for 2020. Company Chief Executive Elon Musk retweeted a story late Friday afternoon titled ""SpaceX skipping Red Dragon for 'vastly bigger ships' on Mars"" that was published on Tesla enthusiasts blog Teslarati. The news comes after Musk said Wednesday that the Hawthorne space company was no longer planning to land its Dragon 2 space capsule using rocket thrusters. The Dragon 2 capsule, which in this case would fly without a crew, was the centerpiece of SpaceX's Red Dragon mission. During an on-stage conversation at the International Space Station Research and Development Conference in Washington, D.C., Musk said that while the capsule is still technically capable of powered landings, it would have to touch down on a ""pretty soft landing pad"" because SpaceX deleted the legs that pop out of the Dragon 2's heat shield. Musk said the Dragon approach to landing on Mars was ""no longer in line with what we were confident was the optimal way of landing on Mars."" Later that day, he replied to a journalist's tweet, saying, ""Plan is to do powered landings on Mars for sure, but with a vastly bigger ship."" It was unclear whether SpaceX is already working on this larger ship or whether the decision would push back a Mars mission launch date. Though Musk never mentioned the Red Dragon mission during Wednesday's speech, reports speculated that the change on Dragon indicated that mission could be canceled. The Red Dragon mission was intended to demonstrate a way to land large payloads on the Red Planet without using parachutes or other aerodynamic decelerators. The capsule was set to be launched by SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket, which is scheduled to make its first flight this year. NASA was set to provide SpaceX with technical support for the mission and was interested in SpaceX's entry, landing and descent data. samantha.masunaga@latimes.com Twitter: @smasunaga",0,human

"The National Party has launched a fresh attack on the Bill English Government's proposed welfare reforms, and announced that it will hold a protest march for their policy this summer. The protest will start on Friday April 26, and will continue until July 29. A spokesperson for the National Party said the march, which is scheduled to start at about 1pm at the corner of Government Avenue and the Esplanade, will be the largest gathering the party had organised in Wellington for the last 20 years, adding the Government's latest welfare reforms ""are a poor reflection of what Kiwis do and value"". They said that the Coalition's changes to the New Zealand Superannuation and Youth Allowance are ""unfortunate"", but could be ""rescinded by the National Party"". This latest protest, the spokesperson said, would bring New Zealand First's ""strong vision"" into the public sphere, and was a fitting way to kick off national party's summer campaign – after being named as the 'Team of the Year' in the latest The Advocate ""Best of the Year"" Awards. A spokesperson for the National Party said the Bill English Government has proposed welfare changes ""that are unfair to the middle class, and will harm the poorest in society, not the Government's aim to help the unemployed, but help those with skills to get back to work."" ""The protest is a show of force for families who have been hurt by this Government. This Government has done nothing to help the families it talks about helping, and so now we'll take our protest to where they have done nothing to help."" The spokesperson said Kiwis understand that people with skills have needs, and that they help to keep the economy running. To date the march, including a media tent, has attracted more than 400 people across the city, with more than 100 attending last week. They said they hoped the march would be as peaceful as possible, and would provide a public forum for people to voice their concerns towards the Government's welfare reform policy. The spokesperson said the march should be a ""positive force in a chaotic political landscape"". Meanwhile, the government has been slammed for its recent announcement that it is seeking to change the way that disability benefits are calculated. The Social Welfare Minister Anne Tolley has suggested that the changes would include the use of a computerisation code to calculate how people's benefits were calculated. ""I'm not saying our current way of doing things is perfect. It's not"", she told Morning Report on Friday morning. She said changes to the DLA (Disability Living Allowance) – which helps people who can live independently due to a medical condition – were proposed by Parliament last year. ""The Government's policy to do some of those things is under consideration. In order to do that, the Treasury Department's going to have to do some work. The first step is there could be adjustments to the disability payment model,"" she said. However, the Opposition Labour Party says this could mean more hardship for people who were already struggling. The opposition said an independent review should be conducted, which would see the government looking at ways to give people more help in a way that does not require the benefit to be worked out on a computer, or calculate a person's payment in an automated way. ""It's very hard to find an alternative to a process that involves people having to find the information for themselves . There's no doubt about what we would be likely to find and the consequences would be very significant,"" Shadow Social Services Minister Steven Joyce said. The shadow work and pensions spokeswoman Ravi Vakil said the Government's welfare changes, combined with the government's failure to invest in affordable housing, should worry everyone. ""These are not policies that create jobs. They are policies that will mean more hardship and more people out of poverty because people won't be given the support that they need,"" Vakil said.",1,ai

"The beginnings of the cycleway. Wikimedia Commons Drivers in Los Angeles spend an average of 90 hours a year stuck in traffic. But back in the 1890s, California imagined a different future for the city's streets. The state planned to build a for-profit, six-mile bike-only highway only for bikes that would stretch from Pasadena to downtown Los Angeles. It was the brainchild of Pasadena resident Horace Dobbins, who began construction after city approval in 1897. Three years later, it opened as an elevated tollway that collected 10 cents per biker, or about $2.50 in today's money. Only 1.3 miles of the cycleway were actually built. The city tore it down a decade later since it never made a profit. The California Cycleway's planned route. Google Maps The cycleway may sound like a far-fetched idea today, but at the time, most Americans moved through cities by foot, historian and author Peter Norton told Business Insider. City folk weren't yet sure if they should adopt cars. ""Many experts and ordinary people agreed that cars didn't really belong in cities,"" he said. ""They made a lot of sense in the country, but in the city, they demanded too much space, drove pedestrians off the streets, and injured too many people."" The California Cycleway likely failed because it was meant for recreation, rather than for efficient commutes, according to Norton. For those who rode bikes as an inexpensive way to get around, the toll seemed steep. The timing of the construction was also unfortunate; the Cycleway was built just as recreational cycling was going out of fashion. Local cycling clubs and activist groups like the League of American Wheelmen competed against powerful auto manufacturers and wealthy car owners. ""The future was not so much a natural evolution, but more a struggle for control,"" Norton said. The League of American Wheelmen circa 1880s. Wikimedia Commons Today, most city infrastructure is still planned around the needs of cars. But many cities (especially European ones) are trying to change that by building extensive bike lanes and improving public transit. Oslo recently announced that it will ban cars from its city center by 2019, and Madrid plans to do the same by 2020. The city of Copenhagen is also building 26 cycling superhighways that will span 186 miles, while Xiamen, China opened a suspended cycleway for a monthlong trial in early 2017 that allows for 2,023 bicycles at a time. Although it'd be a giant feat, Norton said a similar cycleway could work in California and elsewhere in the US. ""The sheer madness of America's lavish energy consumption and public health disasters have compelled people to look for good alternatives, and there are plenty,"" he said. The country may just get one in the coming years. The East Coast Greenway Alliance is working on a 2,900-mile bike path that will link Maine to Florida. Today, it has about 850 miles of trails. By 2020, the organization plans to add 200 more, and have 95% of the trail done by 2030 — which would make it the largest bike trail in the US.",0,human

"As an entrepreneur, I have been fortunate to find support from mentors and others. A big part of this process is making sure that new contacts have the confidence to be around me. One of the many benefits of networking is creating relationships, and in this post I will share one such example that helped establish a meaningful, lasting partnership. Meet Me in My Closet My first job was as a customer service rep for a small manufacturing company. When I graduated from college, I thought I would move to Silicon Valley and work on some ""cool"" products. But soon after graduating I decided to move back home to be a stay at home mom. Now, I didn't just want to be a stay at home mom—I wanted to use my own skills to help people, so I started marketing on my own. I had already worked a small consulting business in the hospitality industry for many years. After my family moved back home, I took my consulting job and turned it into a full-time business. After working at a number of small companies, I had a pretty good idea of the type of marketing opportunities I would create. What I didn't know was that I also worked in an area that many would consider odd. I was an ""outsourcing"" rep for a company that did everything from building office space, furniture, and furnishing stores to building offices and furniture. This company had an interesting mix of responsibilities, so I got my start in sales: Offering to help new employees with their relocation issues Shopping for furniture for other new employees' apartment and houses Providing furniture and furniture accessories for office staff Keeping track of the furniture from the office to the house If I had to pick just one type of customer service, outsourcing had to be higher on the list. You can get away with less work if you don't rely upon your own employees, but if you need support from someone else to get work done, that can quickly become costly. It was one thing to manage my own time and schedule, but it was another to help other people, especially new employees, with their relocation issues. That type of customer service, when done well, is the heart and soul of a great business. One Day, in the Middle of the Night One morning in mid-2012, I received a call from a coworker in a nearby office who was having the same problem as I had. She had recently moved a couch from her office into her bedroom. This resulted in a pile of stuff on the floor and a mess of cables. The problem was not new: the company had had this issue in the past, so they had hired consultants to help customers with their issues. This particular problem involved a new feature that the company was introducing, and it had been causing a backlog of requests for furniture. The problem was a good one, and it became clear that I would be helping customers in need. I asked her about it, and she mentioned it was something that was common for women. I was a woman, and I immediately thought of the countless times I had asked others for furniture and help. The fact that it was a female problem was a red flag, but I pressed forward. I arrived at the coworker's new apartment at approximately 8 am, just in time to find a pile of furniture in the middle of the living room. The problem was that the company had been forced in a cost saving measure, so one of the company's executives had hired a contractor to do the work. They had just hired two new employees who both had two kids and were still struggling to pay their rent. The company was trying to give all the work to one person—because it was one person (the company) who would be paying for it. The woman who would be working this job had just moved from her home in New York into a new apartment in the heart of Manhattan. She told me she had the same problem. So, there it was for all to see. Not just the pile of furniture, but the pile of work sitting in a new office where the CEO was getting ready to meet with his new employee. I was given several options: take out the trash immediately and put it in the trash can outside, or go to the basement and start organizing it. I chose to try and keep everything out of view of the CEO. As we were moving furniture to the basement door, one of the workers told me that his daughter had just been hired and would be on call if we needed help with anything. They had even created a designated spot for that, so the daughter could be on call right alongside them. She was a good influence, but I would go anyway. I had to move all this furniture fast. We moved the furniture from one location to the next, slowly working our way toward the basement. In the process, we took out boxes, took out appliances, and removed carpet",1,ai

"It's always hard to gauge how an NBA front office will react to trades and signings, because the business is so difficult. It's not that teams don't want to make a decision, it's more that they don't want to commit to it until they feel certain. But sometimes, when the smoke clears and they look back and see what has happened, they say it could have been done in a different way. Take the Cleveland front office, for instance. They traded Kyrie Irving to Boston for Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder and Ante Zizic – a trade that was supposed to give Cleveland two star players at a cheaper cost. The league, naturally, didn't think so. So now the Kings are about to trade De'Aaron Fox in a sign-and-trade for Sacramento's 2017 No. 1 pick. Called on all hours of the night and often on days off to give Kings fans hope, GM Vlade Divac said he feels confident about the future of the Kings' organization. ""The front office is looking through things right now, but I've got confidence that we're going to be very solid there,"" Divac said. ""And we're going to take care of business at the end of the season and get back to the playoffs."" The Kings have been under .500 for much of the season but have been playing better of late, and the future looked bright with Fox at the helm. That will be harder to achieve with the 23-year-old center out through at least the 2017-18 season. But if Fox comes back in 2017-18, the Kings will be back in playoff contention. Especially since a healthy team makes it much harder for a lottery-bound team to slide under the playoff bubble. If history is any guide, teams that trade their No. 1 picks usually find a replacement in a few years – but not always. Ainge traded Irving to the Boston Celtics for Marcus Smart, Jae Crowder, two 2017 first-round picks, a 2022 and 2023 second-round pick and $5.9 million in cash. The Celtics are now in the playoff hunt after making a run last season. In 2012, in the same deal, the Golden State Warriors sent the No. 1 pick for Kevin Durant and Iguodala. Durant later won the MVP award and the title with the Oklahoma City Thunder. But the Warriors missed the playoffs and were bounced by the Spurs in the first round. The same year, the Philadelphia 76ers traded the No. 1 pick for Jrue Holiday and the No. 31 pick at the 2012 NBA Draft. The Sixers missed the playoffs in 2011-12 and missed the playoffs in 2012-13 as well before winning the 2012 NBA championship. The Kings were in good position to land Irving if Divac had the guts to take the high-risk move to trade his franchise player. Instead, he decided that the money and his team's chances at the playoffs outweighed the chance of a major step back in his relationship with an NBA front office.",1,ai
"The ""American Horror Story"" creator says he and co-showrunner Ryan Murphy are not done tinkering with the new season of their Emmy-winning series Mick Jagger's first public comments about season seven of American Horror Story since The American Journal of Psychiatry announced last week it was rebranding from ""American Horror Story: Hotel"" into ""The American Psycho"" have been pretty bleak and sad. Speaking to Billboard's Michael Rapaport at LA's Museum of Contemporary Art, Jagger spoke of how, since the sixth and seventh seasons of the show, Murphy and co-showrunner Ryan Murphy had been planning changes to it to ""fix"" the drama -- which has become an Emmy-winning series. ""Ryan and I started working on it, and we were like, 'Oh, this isn't really doing it for us. There's too many rules and too many characters and too much exposition,'"" he said, to which Rapaport responded: ""Then what? Are you saying you have all these little things in the scripts that you've already thought of changing? Are you saying you're going to change the characters?"" ""For the last four years, Ryan and I had talked,"" Jagger said. ""And so, and I thought, I hope this season is going to be our best season yet. I know it will be."" He added: ""But, and I told everyone I want to do a musical episode. It was Ryan and I, but it was like, there's already a musical episode, and that's like the third or fourth musical episode in four years, this season. So, he thought I might go and see somebody to get that out of their system. ""So he goes to this psychiatrist and she has a meeting at this, this fancy hotel about a musical episode that nobody wanted because there's too much exposition but he convinced her to do 'American Psycho'. And we had one of our writers, [Jeff] Schaffer, he was the writer, go down and write a musical episode."" Jagger's admission that his first season was his best comes after several reports that suggest the final season will be the show's last.",1,ai
"There were many different ways for the Jets to lose their opener. They could have pulled the upset, but the Seahawks just pulled the same move that knocked them out of the playoffs last year. They could have been the laughing stock of the NFL, which is exactly what happened. However, the Jets might be even more frustrated that they won't have a bye week to regroup. This team is not yet equipped to contend in the NFL at this point, however, as the loss to the Saints proved. The defense could certainly be improved, but they're still pretty bad and just another reason for the Jets to worry. The Jets lost rookie starter Christian Hackenberg and backup Bryce Petty, as well as their top offensive weapon, Geno Smith. The most frustrating part about the Jets season so far is that no one has talked about the quarterback situation, and that lack of information could be the deciding factor in the final three games. The Jets have a strong front seven anchored by Muhammad Wilkerson and Sheldon Richardson. The front was the main reason why the Jets were able to dominate the Saints defense. They're the team's best edge rusher and secondary defender, and the Jets will be counting on those two. However, the Jets have yet to find that big time pass rusher for the second consecutive season. The Patriots took advantage of the Jets weak pass protection. When Geno Smith was pressured, he was not as effective as he was against the Patriots. Geno Smith was only pressured on 22 percent of his dropbacks, and he had some of the worst numbers of his career. He was pressured on 13 percent of his dropbacks. However, that number will go down dramatically once Jeremy Maclin returns. Geno showed a lot of promise in the fourth quarter against the Patriots, but he played much better in the second half. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough. He threw three interceptions, including one on a pick six. If the Jets don't replace Geno and add some pressure, the defense will struggle. However, it will be interesting to see how the Jets offense responds if Geno and Bryce Petty continue to struggle. The Jets offense was lacking. While it took time to work the receivers all the way into the zone running game after Jeremy Kerley went down, they came through once Kerley was healthy. They still lack a proper running game, as they were still using second quarter power runs. The Jets rushing attack averaged 3.3 yards on the ground, an increase of just 7 yards from the year before. However, the Jets offense as a whole only averaged 3.1 yards on the ground the year before, and that's also a career low. The rushing offense will have to find a way to produce runs when they're trying to stop the run, or it's going to be another long day for Geno Smith. After he showed promise, Geno has really regressed. The Jets defense came into the season with the No. 6 ranked rush defense, but it's been their defense that's been the biggest disappointment to this point. Only the Falcons and Chiefs are ranked lower than the Jets. Jets defensive coordinator Kacy Rodgers has been fired after leading this unit to the worst win-loss record in NFL history. Kacy Rodgers is a good defensive coordinator, but given the fact the Jets defense was awful. It's hard to see anyone succeeding Kacy Rodgers. If the Jets want to stay in contention, the team will need to draft a strong defensive side of the ball, and that should start next week. It wasn't a good day for the running backs but the Jets offensive line wasn't exactly the greatest. If Ryan Fitzpatrick is sacked four times a game, then there is going to be some issues. The Jets could've put the game away against the Saints, but they could have done something that the Jets didn't do last season: give up the lead. They still have a lot of work to do, and Geno Smith and the Jets offense aren't ready to show what they can do.",1,ai

"From Zelda Wiki, the Zelda encyclopedia The Light Spirit is a character featured in Skyward Sword.[5][6] He is Link's ancestor and the reincarnation of the Triforce. Link obtains the Light Spirit by using the Magical Mirror found on the Great Bay Temple in order to link with the Goddess Hylia and his past self, and thus becoming a part of Hylia's Light Force. It is implied that Link's Light Spirit possesses the Power of Three (the Light Spirit has the Power of Three; the Mirror is the ""Triforce""[7]). Biography Spoiler warning : Plot or ending details follow. Upon Link's return with the power of the Triforce, Hylia instructs him to restore the Triforce to its original form.[8] When Link obtains the Triforce in Skyward Sword, he is able to use its energy to create the Mirror of Twilight, a device that transports him back to the land of Hyrule, where he obtains the Light Spirit's Mirror from his ancestor the Hero of Time. Thus, Link becomes Hylia's reincarnated ancestor.[9] In Twilight Princess As the Master Sword is broken and Link is powerless to defend himself against the Dark Beasts attacking Hyrule, it is the Light Spirit that shows up in the Temple of Time and helps him escape the Dark Beasts. In one of the ending cutscene Hylia is shown to be alive and well in the Temple of Time and talks to Link and mentions that Link is his reincarnation and tells Link that he has returned to save his Master.[4] Later in Link's story, Link encounters Hyleas, the spirit of his ancestor, to whom Hylia gives him the Light Spirit's Mirror. In Skyward Sword After Link defeats Ganondorf, the Skyward Sword returns him to his true self in the Skyward Sword, where Hylia tells him that his true name is Link.[10] He tells that he was chosen by the goddess Hylia for a ""great destiny.""[11] At the end of the game, it is revealed that he is a reincarnation of the Hero of Time which hints to the idea that he is also Hylia. In Ocarina of Time In Ocarina of Time, after Link defeats the final boss the Goddess Hylia appears to him in a vision, and tells him to use the Triforce on the last day, which is his birth certificate. Link uses the Triforce to return the Ocarina to its pedestal, making Hylia appear to him again as a young girl and asks about his future. He is told that he'll be playing with his ""friends and relatives"" in a distant world. In reality the Ocarina is in the possession of Princess Zelda, who had been ordered to keep it from anyone as it is of great power. In Breath of the Wild As a descendant of the Hero of Time, the Light Spirit appears in Breath of the Wild. If Link has the Spiritual Medallion from the previous games, it will be automatically added to his inventory upon entering Hyrule Castle. Other Appearances Non-Canon Information hide show Trivia The Light Spirits share similar names to their original counterparts, they are Hylians as well.

"The state of Washington is considering making a new, controversial method for collecting wastewater that treats billions of gallons of the state's brackish water available in all municipal water supplies around the state. The process, called reverse osmosis, purifies drinking water by removing 99.9999999 percent of all naturally occurring salts and minerals. It's also used in treatment for industrial and municipal sewage. The problem is that most of these brackish waters are contaminated with high levels of metals like copper and iron, which are known carcinogens. Some of the contaminants from that state's water supply – that of Spokane to the west and Yakima to the east – have been linked to birth defects in infants. The Department of Ecology wants to add reverse osmosis to its list of water treatment options to treat about 30 mln mls of water for municipal water systems from Spokane county to southern Walla Walla county. Most of the water is treated in urban areas, with the rest used to irrigate farm land. Reverse osmosis is already used in Spokane and other urban areas and by farms that process some of the brackish water for livestock consumption. The Spokane city council passed a resolution requiring all water suppliers in the region to test each year their water supplies for elevated levels of heavy metals. Those levels are considered a ""serious health problem"" and ""reasonably predicted to cause adverse human health or environmental impacts."" Opposition has been fierce, and there's even been a lawsuit, with the Spokane County sheriff's office leading the case against the state water agency. The county said the state is interfering with city water supplies. The water commission will meet again on March 30 to review the potential reverse osmosis rule. Should lawmakers approve it, the new treatment may be available statewide by 2020. (H/T: The Raw Story)",1,ai
"Last year, an 11-year-old girl killed herself after being raped twice at day-care centers in New Jersey. Since then, another 11-year-old girl who was also sexually assaulted had attempted suicide and was rushed to the hospital, where she died. As of July 23rd, 2016, there have been 16 women who have attempted suicide in the United States as a result of sexual assault that they experienced. There is an average of three cases of female suicide each week. This number includes any victims of both sexual assault and rape. In July, 2016, the New York Times published an article about how these statistics have grown over the years. The Times looked at the results of a recent study which looked at suicide attempts, sexual assault, rape and abuse, and child abuse deaths. The study revealed the following statistics for sexual assault victims: An estimated 1.7 million people experience sexual assault each year -- a 1 in 4 rate. One in every seven women are sexually assaulted before they are 18 years old. This includes sexual assaults at day-care centers, colleges, and university campuses. A woman is raped every five minutes in the United States. Between 1995 and 2010, 2.8 million children were reported as victims of sexual abuse. There were a total of 7.8 million sexual assaults in the United States between 1995 and 2010. The American Psychological Association (APA) describes rape as ""the violent physical abuse of another person through the use or threat of force or with the use of an object or other means."" Some of the most common ways of rape include: Being pinned down or pinned up to a wall. Being forced to give oral or anal sex. Being forced to perform other sexual acts. Having an object inserted into or pushed into vaginal or rectal area. Being forced to perform other sex acts. Being forced to have sex in multiple positions. Being forced to perform sexual acts while being drunk. Being forced to have sex while under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Being forced to have sex with others in a position that causes serious bodily injury or pain. Being forced to perform sexual acts with an animal. Being exposed to or witnessing another person being sexually assaulted. Not being able to move or speak normally, as a result of the sexual assault. Not being able to provide for your own needs due to the sexual abuse. Being forced to have pre or post-surgical sex. Being forced to have oral or anal sex. Being forced to perform other sex acts. Being physically or sexually abused as a child. Getting help The best thing anyone can do if they are experiencing feelings of shame or fear that they have been sexually assaulted is to seek help. If you have been sexually assaulted or believe you have been, we encourage you to speak up, even if it makes you feel scared or uncomfortable. You can speak about the incident to your doctor, friend, or school counselor; to your church or community leader. Also, you can make a plan with your doctor to seek health care help if necessary. You can find a hotline in your state on our resources page. What can you do? If you have been sexually assaulted, you may be experiencing feelings of shame and embarrassment. You may be concerned about hurting yourself. To overcome the feelings of shame or fear about your assault, you can do three things: Keep in mind: It is never your fault. You are a victim of something that happened to you -- not an offender. Be honest with yourself: When you think about what happened to you, try to remember what really happened. Find a support system. You could talk about your assault with a counselor, counselor friend, therapist, or religious leader who can give you support and help you work through your feelings. You can also be a good role model to others. In order to stay strong and continue to get help, you and anyone you know should: Listen to your body's reactions and do what feels right. Be careful how you dress or wear make-up. Don't hesitate to tell a teacher, school administration, or doctor if you are not feeling well. You can find a good self-help resource, or you may call or visit the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network in a Safe Place if you or someone you know is experiencing feelings of shame or fear and does not know where to turn. What can you do if you think you may have been sexually assaulted? If you have been sexually assaulted, call: 888.622.HOPE (4673). You can reach the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network (RAINN) 24 hours a day, 7 days",1,ai
"I have to say, I don't think I have ever seen that happen before. The story behind the photo of a black woman trying her damnedest to pull down a white supremacist's MAGA hat and then get her shit kicked for it? It all started when a white woman came up to a black woman (who's name I can't even quote) and told her she would not be able to do a Nazi-themed photo shoot with the other woman because of her race. I'm paraphrasing wildly here. It was not so much her words, but more the tone of her voice and facial expressions, that I can't put into words. Here's the screenshot from her Instagram: The point? How stupid you look trying to wear that shit in public. The woman in question — according to her publicist — was trying desperately the pull her shit down when her friend, the woman's photographer, came over and physically kicked and threw her to the ground.

"In the US, the legal process for requesting asylum is simple — you fill out a refugee application. You do this at the local US embassy in your country, and if they're willing to give it into your hands, all happens immediately. The other countries have a system in place that's more detailed. You have your fingerprints taken, you're interviewed and your cases screened, and if they find someone qualified, the case is filed. The rest is done in an effort to make sure that your claim for asylum is strong, and the process takes some time. This isn't the case for the asylum-seekers who arrived in Canada this week, however. Because Canada has a stricter screening process for refugee claims, some of the people who had filed claims at the US embassy in Ottawa said they had never heard of Canada's system. ""I have lived in every country in the world, so I've never been to Canada, but I have heard of Canada,"" said Ibrahim Buhari, who is from Niger and had applied for asylum in the United States in 2016. Buhari, who was accompanied by his sister, said that they were sent back before their application could be processed in the United States, but his sister had heard about Canada's claims system through the news. When they got to Canada, Buhari said the immigration officials told them to get lost. The government isn't responsible for you ""We went to the immigration office and they gave us a document that basically tells you, you have 10 days of stay in Canada, you have 15 days to apply to leave, you have 15 days to get out of here, and within the first 30 days of your stay in Canada, you're not allowed to apply for immigration,"" Buhari said. Buhari said he had never heard of Canada's asylum process before arriving at Toronto's Pearson International Airport, and he had some confusion about who the government was. ""When we got to Canada, the immigration officials told us to get lost. The government isn't responsible for you,"" he said. ""So they left us alone."" The government of Canada is ""not responsible"" for people who arrived with US visas and then left the country as their asylum applications were being processed. A spokesperson for the Canadian High Commission confirmed this in an email. Buhari and his sister are now in Montreal, waiting for their asylum cases to be resolved. Canada's asylum system is ""quite a bit more complicated,"" Buhari said. ""You have to prepare your case and give as much detail, and provide your name, and the names of people who you've spoken to, and all the things that they expect you to do."" One of the factors considered is whether you're a sex offender, and if so, you also need to provide evidence that you've been clean of any sexual violations in your country of origin for at least a year. Another factor is whether you have a criminal past that includes ""serious violence or threats of violence."" One-hundred percent of people in Canada who apply for asylum fail, but Buhari says they shouldn't be, since they have much better chances of getting asylum here than they would in the US. As for how long it takes to come to this country: ""It could take four or five years,"" Buhari said. 'No one can tell you when' [you get] asylum At the time of his asylum application, Buhari was accused of beating his then-girlfriend. If he had been found guilty, he would have faced between three and five years in prison, including the option of deportation. ""You want to hear the horror story?"" said Buhari, laughing. ""That would mean you leave a country where you are now living, have a country where you don't know the language, and you have a country where you don't know anybody."" The process of getting asylum can take up to five years or more, and Buhari is sure his refugee case will be delayed. He'd like to get to his mother and brother by next May, but he said that it's possible he could remain in Canada as long as six months before his application is assessed. ""There is no guarantee there will be a decision at the end of January,"" he said. This isn't his first mistake. He said he wasn't aware that you can leave Canada to have a ""temporary stay"" — it's legal, but it's unclear exactly what that is and when there's a cutoff point. This means that if his claim is rejected, Buhari could stay here even longer. ""I will be very sad, but I can't get another job here, no one can tell you when you are allowed to stay in Canada, so it's just a matter of patience,"" Buhari said. But if it comes down to it, he will have a chance",1,ai
"I have my first attempt at making a homemade cup of coffee, and can proudly say it's pretty darn good. If you're going to make coffee at home there's no better place than an old-school metal mug with a paper filter in the bottom, because that's the only way you're really going to get that coffee taste. First I made up a batch of hot water with a glass ball at the bottom, which is what is supposed to be the 'best tasting' setting. I filled it up with a good cup of coffee. Then I took the filter out, boiled it over a cup of hot tap water and put it over the heating element. I got a very nice coffee smell from this one. Then I poured some hot water in the mug, let it sit for a minute or so before drinking it, and I was really impressed. The grounds were pretty much gone after about 10 seconds. The whole process took me about a third of a second, which is really fast, and the water temperature was between 185-190 degrees F. I was also able to brew an extra cup of coffee before getting to eat. As it happens, I have a bit of a conundrum regarding coffee, in that I really like it, but can't afford to buy it. It seems like there is a good deal of difference between good coffee and really great coffee, and as you probably know, there's no such thing as a cheap coffee. On the other hand, there are a whole bunch of companies where you can buy fresh coffee for a couple of dollars per gram. I'm sort of at the 'less than best quality"" end of that spectrum. It's a good way to brew coffee, but since I have a lot of cheap coffee grinds lying around, I'm going to have to make a new batch for now.",1,ai
"After a two-week hiatus, Alec Baldwin returned to portray President Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live – the first time he has done so since the inauguration on January 20. In a spoof of the new president's first two weeks in office, the show's cold open shows Trump phoning the prime minister of Australia, the president of Mexico, the chancellor of Germany, and the president of Zimbabwe – with the Grim Reaper (Steve Bannon) by his side in the Oval Office. The skit begins with an aide to Trump telling his boss - wearing a Russian flag pin on his lapel - that he's about to go home for the night. 'How do you like working at the White House?' Trump asks. 'Are your parents proud?' After a two-week hiatus, Alec Baldwin returned to portray President Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live – the first time he has done so since the inauguration on January 20 President Donald Trump is spoofed on Saturday Night Live along with his chief strategist, Steve Bannon (right), played by the Grim Reaper 'I tell them I work at Applebee's,' he said. Trump then inquires about his daughter, Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner. He tells the aide that 'they always keep me so calm and make sure i don't do anything too crazy.' When Trump is told that they do not work on the Jewish Sabbath, he says: 'When the Jews are away, the goys will play.' Trump is then joined in the Oval Office by 'Steve Bannon,' portrayed by the Grim Reaper. After Trump tells 'Bannon' that he has had a long day, he picks up the phone and calls Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, played by cast member Beck Bennett. 'I hear there's been a lot of blowback over your Muslim ban,' Turnbull tells Trump. 'No there wasn't,' Trump says. 'Everyone loves it. We had to do it because of that huge massacre at Bowling Green.' That was a reference to Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway's false claim that refugees were responsible for a massacre at Bowling Green even though that never happened. The skit begins with an aide to Trump telling his boss that he's about to go home for the night. 'How do you like working at the White House?' Trump asks. 'Are your parents proud?' 'I tell them I work at Applebee's,' the aide said before Trump calls in 'Bannon' With Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner not working due to the Jewish Sabbath, Trump and 'Bannon' are left to their own devices When Turnbull told Trump that he had never heard of it, Trump said: 'It was horrible. So many people died, but they're the lucky ones. They don't have to see how bad The Apprentice has gotten.' That joke was in reference to Trump's remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast earlier this week taunting Arnold Schwarzenegger for his ratings on the latest version of the show once hosted by Trump. Turnbull then thanks Trump for honoring the agreement made by his predecessor to accept 1,200 refugees – to which a stunned Trump replied: 'Homey say what?' 'Your compassion will not be forgotten,' the Australian leader tells Trump. The president then replies: 'No, no, no.' 'America first, Australia sucks, prepare to go to war,' Trump tells Turnbull before hanging up. When Trump asks 'Bannon' if 'the call was bad,' the advisor gives his approval. 'No, it went just according to plan,' he says.

"Concrete Examples of Orderings There is a commonly used strategy, often called lexicographical order or dictionary order, for taking the ordering strategies for individual components and combining them. Last week, I noted that if you have an object with two components, each of which you know how to order independently, it requires at least a little thought to figure out how to do so. Moreover, there is a commonly used strategy, often called lexicographical order or dictionary order, for taking the ordering strategies for individual components and combining them. The C++ library is considerate enough to implement dictionary ordering for its users in (at least) three places. The first is the std::pair template, which defines the six comparison operators in terms of the corresponding operators of the pair's components. Specifically, pair(x1, y1) < pair(x2, y2) is defined as x1<x2 || (!(x2 < x1) && y2 < y1) Note that this definition is careful to use only < on components, not > or ==. Part of its technique for doing so rests on the fact that the comparison x2 < x1 can take place only when it has already been established that x1<x2 is false, so that !(x2 < x1) is really a clever way of saying x2 == x1 without using == or !=. Analogously, pair(x1, y1) == pair(x2, y2) is defined as x1 == x2 && y1 == y2 This definition is careful to use only == to define == on pairs. You might think that the other four comparison operators would be defined in terms of the corresponding operators on the component, but you would be wrong. Instead, pair(x1, y1) > pair(x2, y2) is defined as pair(x2, y2) < pair(x1, y1) pair(x1, y1) != pair(x2, y2) is defined as !(pair(x1, y1) == pair(x2, y2)) pair(x1, y1) <= pair(x2, y2) is defined as !(pair(x1, y1) > pair(x2, y2)) pair(x1, y1) >= pair(x2, y2) is defined as !(pair(x1, y1)< pair(x2, y2)) The underlying principles are easy to understand once explained: The pair template never depends on more than the == and < operations on the components. Order relations are defined entirely in terms of other order relations. Equality relations are defined entirely in terms of other equality relations. If the element types have relations defined that meet the library requirements, then the resulting relations on pairs will also meet the library requirements. As a generalization of pair , the library tuple template also implements the six comparison operators in terms of < and == on the tuple 's elements. Like pair , tuple does not reply on the other four comparison operators on elements. The third place where the library implements dictionary order is in the lexicographical_compare algorithm. This algorithm accepts two pairs of iterators, each of which defines a range of elements, and uses an extended version of this comparison procedure to compare the sequences: If both sequences have the same length and every element is equal to the corresponding element of the other sequence, the two sequences are considered equal. This case holds even if both sequences are empty. If one sequence is a prefix of the other, the shorter sequence is considered less than the other. Otherwise, the result of the comparison is the result of comparing the elements that make up the first discrepancy between the sequences. This function offers an easy way to define sequence comparison in terms of element comparison when all the elements have the same type. Unless there is a good reason to do otherwise, one's first thought about how to define comparison between two data structures should probably be to compare the data structure's elements along the lines that we've been discussing. The main mistake that beginners make is to believe that it is possible to define pair(x1, y1) < pair(x2, y2) as something such as x1 < x2 && y1 < y2 , which doesn't work. There is another pitfall in defining comparison relations: Sometimes the obvious way of comparing individual elements doesn't always work. We'll look at some examples of that pitfall next week.",0,human

"Following a weekend crammed with ever more salacious revelations about Harvey Weinstein, hundreds of thousands of women have now taken to social media to share their own experiences of sexual harassment. This is called the '#MeToo' movement, and it's gone viral, in the way that these things do. According to Twitter, this reveals 'the magnitude of sexual assault'. In reality, it does nothing of the sort. #MeToo tells us far more about the desire of some women to reach for victimhood status. The accusations against Weinstein include charges of rape; as such, they deserve to be taken seriously and tried in courts of law rather than by public opinion. At this moment Hollywood's leading ladies don't just have the public's attention but widespread sympathy too. But it doesn't stop there. We live in a fame-obsessed culture, and just as many women might emulate a star's diet or dress sense, they also want in on the sympathy too. #MeToo is an unedifying clamour to be included in celebrity suffering. The #MeToo social media revelations blur the boundary between sexual assault and sexual harassment. 140 character reports of having been raped are placed on a par with tweets about name calling, whistling and groping. The #MeToo process helps create a false impression that all men are sexually abusive and simply waiting for an opportunity to assault innocent and defenceless women. Worse, serious crimes are trivialised as the #MeToo tweeters who recount some relatively minor (albeit discomforting) experience are equally blessed with retweets, likes and public endorsements praising their bravery. Blurring the boundaries between rape and ever-broader definitions of sexual harassment doesn't just trivialise serious offences, it further inflames a climate of hysteria in which the sexual harassment of women comes to be presented as a routine part of life. Life for women is presented as a battleground where we are all only one bad joke, one wolf whistle or one stare away from being assaulted. It also creates an impression that being a woman in the 21st century is a living hell. Not only is this false, it is destructive. In 2015, Girl Guiding UK found that seventy-five per cent of girls and young women said anxiety about potentially experiencing sexual harassment affects their lives in some way. A 2016 survey suggested that 41 per cent of young women expect to face discrimination at work. These young women had not faced harassment or discrimination: their anxiety was around what might, potentially, happen to them in the future. It may be the fear of sexual harassment, more than the reality, that is holding women back today. Twitter is by default a narcissistic platform: users must assume the world wants public updates on their thoughts and feelings. But yesterday's #MeToo Twitter-trend only shows us the sorry state of feminism today.

"As I lay back in the hospital bed, cradling my softly sleeping baby girl against my chest, my head was burning hot with anger. I could barely look at her, so innocent and helpless, without feeling an overwhelming desire to sob with a rage and pain that I thought I had buried deep within me. A snippet of a dream curled into the edge of my consciousness. Her dream of the calm, warmth of my womb and the sound of my heartbeat. It was just as the nurse had said, I could hear her in my head. I could hear her hunger, the pain when she had gas and the ever present need to be reassured that Mommy was close. I had sent Jeff home to pick up some extra clothes for our daughter. He had left with his own head in a daze. Finding out you could hear your child's thoughts was not easy to digest. I don't think he had put things together quite yet though. There was a knock on the door before it opened. I saw my mom and dad poke their heads in, faces lit up with excitement to see their grandchild. Until they saw my face, twisted with rage. ``You knew,'' I spat. ``You knew and you let it happen anyway. How could you?'' ``Oh honey, we didn't know what to do. He was our son too. You don't know what he was thinking,'' my mom soothed. ``I was six! He was old enough to know better. You knew! You knew the whole time!'' I was screaming now. My daughter stirred in my arms and began to cry. I could feel her uncertainty about the loud noise. ``Don't be so dramatic about it. You're scaring the baby,'' my mom snapped back, on the defensive. ``You need to leave now,'' someone else said from the doorway. It was Jeff. I had never seen him look so angry. My parents protested but Jeff stepped toward them with a look in his eyes that told me he knew what I was feeling.

"It's true that you don't have to wash jeans as frequently as you would other types of clothing, like t-shirts or underwear. This is because jeans are typically made from a sturdy, durable fabric that doesn't get as dirty or smelly as easily as lighter, more absorbent fabrics. However, this doesn't mean that you should never wash your jeans at all. Even though jeans may not get as dirty as quickly, they can still pick up odors, stains, and germs over time. If you wear your jeans multiple times between washings, they may start to smell and look less fresh. In addition, if you spill something on your jeans or get them dirty in some other way, it's a good idea to wash them to remove the stain and any bacteria that may have accumulated. So, while you don't need to wash your jeans as often as other types of clothing, it's still important to give them a wash every once in a while to keep them clean and fresh.",1,ai
"Alternative Procedures for Return Confirmations Essay Some customers do not return confirmations, so alternative procedures must be followed. The alternative procedures aim to define – appealing to methods that are not primary – if the unconfirmed invoice was not a fictitious one (Accounting Tools, 2021). If there is no required confirmation, the approaches below may be considered to validate and evaluate the individual trades that make up the final receivable balance. First is the subsequent cash disbursements. The auditor reviews the evidence of receipt of money after the date of confirmation, notification of transfers, as well as the data recorded in the register of cash receipts or even the following loans reflected in the analytical accounting of receivables (PCAOB, 2021). It should be admitted that checking evidence of subsequent cash disbursements is a beneficial alternative procedure since it is fair to suggest that the customer did not pay if the invoice was fictitious. Nevertheless, the present income does not say anything about whether this obligation was dated on the day indicated in the confirmation. This example can be met in the service sector more frequently. Second, it might be duplicate invoices for sales. They are useful in checking the reality of the invoice for implementation and the validity of the date of the invoice. Third, it is transport documents. They are important in establishing the fact of a shipment and in checking time allocations (Sherman, n.d.). The two latter examples can be easily met in the manufacturing sector. It seems reasonable to state that alternative procedures in the given framework are a good option to undertake, given the number of issues that they can address. It is generally best to follow these procedures in any case of an unconfirmed balance, even when the amount is immaterial. References Accounting Tools. (2021). Alternative procedures definition .

"The most surprising development of this week's FCC meeting was the fact that two of its most vocal supporters -- Rep. Marsha Blackburn and former Sen. John Breaux , a Democrat -- have decided to throw their weight behind the idea that the agency should abandon net neutrality.The FCC's new chairman, Ajit Pai, is expected to propose a plan this week that would eliminate the regulation enacted in December 2015 under former Chairman Tom Wheeler that required major internet firms, such as Facebook and Alphabet's Google, to treat all data equally.A Blackburn spokesman noted to ProPublica that Blackburn had been ""pleading the 5th"" the past few weeks and that on Thursday she will introduce legislation aimed at overturning it. (Blackburn represents the 12th District of Tennessee in Congress, where Internet providers have strong lobbyists.)Brent Skorup of the National Conference of State Legislatures told the AP that Blackburn and her fellow Republicans will look to revive a previous bill from 1999, H.R. 5181, and get to the truth. (It failed to pass.) He also noted that the current bill won't do much to change the ""narrow interpretation"" laid out by Pai himself.A Breaux spokesman said Breaux ""believes in preserving the principles of net neutrality."" He also pointed out that Breaux has been one of Pai's few defenders on the FCC.Breaux made waves in 2002 when he announced he was joining the Republican majority in Congress to help kill an FCC rule that required cable companies to provide customers with free basic service, a provision favored by the cable and telecom industries.His spokeswoman told the AP that Breaux ""believes ISPs have a responsibility to do the same for their customers.""The bill by Blackburn is expected to come to the House floor by next week, and the Senate may as well follow in some cases.

"Sure! Whiskey is a type of alcohol made from grain, such as barley, corn, rye, or wheat. There are many different types of whiskey, and they can be distinguished by how they are made and what they are made from. Here's a breakdown of some common types of whiskey: Single Malt Whiskey: This type of whiskey is made from malted barley and water, and it is produced at a single distillery. Single malt whiskey is often associated with Scotland, but it can also be made in other countries. Triple Distilled Whiskey: This type of whiskey is made by distilling the alcohol three times, which can result in a smoother and more refined flavor. Triple distilled whiskey is often made in Ireland. Scotch Whiskey: Scotch whiskey is a type of whiskey that is made in Scotland from malted barley, water, and yeast. It must be aged for at least three years in oak barrels to be called Scotch. Bourbon Whiskey: Bourbon is a type of American whiskey that is made from a mixture of grains, including at least 51% corn. It is aged in new, charred oak barrels, which gives it a distinct flavor and color. I hope this helps explain the differences between these types of whiskey!

"A House bill banning abortions after 20 weeks on Monday received the official backing of the Trump administration. The White House ""strongly supports"" the Republican efforts to ""secure critical pro-life protections"" and believes ""America's children deserve the stronger protections"" that the bill would provide. ""The bill, if enacted into law, would help to facilitate the culture of life to which our Nation aspires,"" the statement said. ""Additionally, the bill would promote a science-based approach to unborn life, as recent advancements have revealed that the physical structures necessary to experience pain are developed within 20 weeks of fertilization."" Arizona Republican Rep. Trent Franks is sponsoring the bill and it is scheduled to come up for a vote Tuesday in the House. The bill would criminalize abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, introducing fines and jail sentences — up to five years — for those who perform or attempt an abortion. The measure would not penalize women seeking abortions after 20 weeks and would allow the procedure in the case of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. Pro-choice groups have come out in staunch opposition to the bill, calling it ""cruel"" and ""unconstitutional."" ""20 week abortion bans are: unpopular, unconstitutional, part of the agenda to ban ALL abortion,"" tweeted Planned Parenthood. The Guttmacher Institute's director of public policy, Heather Boonstra, wrote an op-ed for The Hill, saying the bill's claim that unborn children can feel pain after 20 weeks ""is not supported by the preponderance of scientific evidence."" She also slammed the bill's ""particularly callous and cruel rape and incest exceptions"" that require women to wait 48 hours and have two doctor visits with two different abortion providers before being allowed an abortion. A similar bill passed the House back in 2015 but was later blocked by Senate Democrats, The Hill reported.

Five of the teams combined scored more than three goals. While many of the goals were within tight games, Oregon and Oregon State also each scored four times before the third period. ""We played a lot of games where we scored four goals in the third period and I think a lot of the teams had great goaltending all year, so it was a great experience for us that we didn't see them in our tournament game,"" said Bellotti after the Ducks' win over Stanford last weekend. ""We didn't play a lot of close games as people may think that we would. We did play a lot of games though where we scored four goals in the third and we got the job done."" Bellotti said that playing a lot of tight games with four goals in each of the first two quarters helped to prepare his team better for the second half. ""I thought we played some games where it could easily have been five, seven or ten goals, it was a lot tougher at times than that,"" Bellotti said. ""We played a lot of tight games this year and in those situations, it's a lot more difficult to get the job done and we took advantage of every one of them. The experience from our team in those tight games is going to help us in the future when there are tighter games."" Oregon went 4-1 at the Pac-12 Championships including four victories against Stanford. The Ducks took a 7-4 advantage over Stanford in the first game before the Cardinal fought back to take a pair of late goals to force overtime and a 7-6 win. The Ducks then took a 7-5 lead in the second game, before the Cardinal scored three straight goals to force a shootout to seal their 4-2 win. In addition to Austin's four point game against Cal, the Ducks also earned wins over Texas A&M (6-6), Oregon State (8-5) and Cal State Fullerton (8-6). All four of the losses came in extra-period periods. ""It's a great opportunity,"" said Oregon junior forward Kyle Barbee, who scored the game-winner in extra time to defeat Texas A&M. ""We're glad we got it done on Sunday and the whole team is excited to get some momentum going, but we can only focus on winning, man. We've got to win games and be on top of our game every time."" With the wins on Saturday, the Ducks now control their own fate as they look to the Final Four in Indianapolis to secure their third Pac-12 Championship in three seasons. ""I think we're just looking forward to Saturday,"" said Barbee. ""It's great to be able to finish off a season, but at the same time, we were just playing for each other."" Up next will be the final NCAA tournament stage in the Pac-12 Championship for Oregon and the Ducks' NCAA Tournament winning season. Follow @KareemNBAFollow @MattBrooksNBA",1,ai
"I think the best way to describe my view of the new ""Masters"" series is that the most important feature of the Series is that while the series is called ""The Masters,"" it is actually the ""Masters of the Universe"" in disguise. Now, some may think this is a bit silly, because after all, the Marvel Universe has been around since 1961. If it was so important, then why was it still a secret? One of the great things about the original Marvel Super Hero Comic was that it was a brand new universe, and we never had to worry about Marvel telling us about it. Marvel Universe existed and functioned without us. It was there, but when the time came for it to reveal itself and begin to gain momentum, it was all because the readers cared. The Marvel Universe exists on its own, its own island of heroes, and when we wanted to know more about it, we just asked people. We did not have to wait until the Marvel Universe became the official universe. But that time has arrived… This series is not that. The Master of the Universe has been hiding in plain sight from us all this time. I would have no problem with that if it was a nice change, because I have little problem with the idea of a brand new Masters of the Universe series… But that's not it. If you are going to start a new Masters of the Universe line, you should start with a brand new character, or at least have one new character show up every month and tell us who he is. Not only could this be a good way for you to introduce the new Marvel Universe to new readers, but it can be also a way to tell us who the main characters, villains and supporting cast are. Now maybe you are thinking that this is a good thing, because if it is about the Masters of the Universe, then why would I be complaining if the ""New Masters"" series shows us more of them to? The problem is that the New Masters can't keep their hands off the old Masters. For example… This month, we have a two pages piece of us talking with Tony Stark, about the new Masters series (it is a great story that was written in a really strong way, and I hope the creators have enjoyed working on it). But of course we get more exposition on how the Masters are going to be returning in the next issue, plus a bit of story about how the Masters of the Universe made the changes to their universe after the Annihilation event. Then the next two pages bring the reader directly into the action, as the newly-empowered Masters of the Marvel Universe are engaged in battle against the Annihilation Wave. So let's do a couple things by looking at what we call the ""New Masters of the Universe."" They have brought back the Champions, but with them have come back the Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, the X-men, and even the Masters of Evil – in a team-up with the Champions – against the Annihilation Wave. They have revived the Avengers, the X-men, the Guardians, the Fantastic Four, the Inhumans, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and even the old Masters of Evil against the Annihilation Wave. Now, why is this? Is this a new group of characters, or one with more clout than that? And is it a team-up? I'm not sure, but that's not my concern. How I know they are a ""team-up"" is simply because after reading the New Masters of the Universe comics for over three years, I can count the total number of characters in the ""New Masters"" on one hand, which is pretty damn many. There was the Champions (which now has been absorbed into Captain Marvel), the Hulk, the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Inhumans, the Vision, the Masters of Evil, and the X-men. What this tells us is that the ""New Masters"" are getting a big push, and that if you read all four issues of the comic, then you should know all the characters involved in the ""New Masters"" and how they relate to each other. But I'm getting ahead of myself. I want to talk about what I think is happening here – how the old Masters are still getting a boost. I know that there are some who feel that this is cheating, because we have seen the new Masters (which is a lot of names for the same thing) show up before. But if you go back and read every issue of the original Masters, you know that there were many more than the actual 12. Of course, it was in those early issues that the new Masters would have had the most time to appear. Because now, they have gotten their stories out already and because the ""New Masters"" are about to show up, we are given that much more time before they really show up on the scene. Now I don't know if this is a new",1,ai
"Cricket Star 'Hate Me' Video Released NEWTON, Mass.—After being introduced through a series of YouTube videos, the man known as Hate Me, aka Brian ""Cricket"" McCauley, was arrested this afternoon at his home for the shooting death of a woman on his doorstep Friday afternoon. ""Police are reviewing surveillance video at McCauley's Newton home and have obtained a warrant for the arrest of Cricket McCauley for the murder of his neighbor, Sarah Mears,"" said Newton Police Chief Tim Luecke. ""Mcauley is currently being held at the Newton Police Department awaiting extradition to Massachusetts to face the charges."" The attack on Mears, who was killed by a single gunshot, was shocking to both fans of the man and to the city's residents, an eclectic mix of residents who tend toward either ""haters"" or ""love it 'em."" ""It's really crazy,"" said local fan Michael D'Alessio. ""The city of Newton is a really tight-knit place. It's sad. I just wish it wasn't true. It's just not fair."" While McCauley's arrest was met with a chorus of cries from those who knew him, including Mayor Brian Savage, others were angry at the police's lack of a ""proper reason"" for his arrest. ""The cops can't take a little thing like this and make it become major because they don't have a real case against him,"" said local baseball fanatic Kevin Leighton. McCauley's friend, who went by the name ""Lil Hater"" when talking on his Facebook page, told reporters that McCauley could not be in hiding and expressed hope that he would ""come back to live in Newton."" ""Just imagine, a homeless addict who is always drunk and high, with a gun, and shoots a woman who is trying to help,"" Hater's friend said. He also noted that McCauley would ""probably need to be put in a mental institution for a while"" before being released from jail: The man who was arrested for the shooting death of his neighbor will soon be sent to a mental facility for evaluation with some serious problems. He is a convicted felon who is obviously still under the influence of drugs. The police and legal system will not provide this man with a reasonable accommodation. He can't be under arrest because of a mental illness. He can't be held without bail because the police are unable to prove that he is a danger to the community. We can't just let him get away with it. He does not deserve a life of dignity. Despite McCauley's public apology for killing Mears, the town's residents are still reeling from the sudden tragedy that hit their favorite baseball team. ""Cricket Mears is probably the greatest teammate I ever had,"" said local baseball fan Michael Leighton. ""He always made me laugh and bring smiles to the faces of all my friends."" While the town has mourned Mears' loss, many of the area's residents have taken to Facebook to express their own sorrow for a woman who was loved and cherished by friends and neighbors alike, and who would often try to give those less fortunate rides and a warm smile while she did it. ""Sarah was always a big girl with the biggest heart,"" said local soccer enthusiast Adam Dutton. ""I love how she always was trying to help others and help me out."" While many are understandably distraught by the loss of a woman who was only doing her best to help others, some of McCauley's online supporters are quick to point out that they have a right to kill just as much as he does: ""The first rule of baseball is the first rule of baseball is if you haven't killed anyone before, you haven't really played,"" said local sports fan David Lee. ""We're all grown up now and we have the right to die and die with a decent style of demise.""",1,ai
"Mortgage lenders, credit card companies and payday lenders may need an eye check for debt. WSJ's Joe Parkinson explains. Photo: Getty For the first time since 2009, the U.S. is set to see higher levels of U.S. household debt: A record $10.3 trillion of it is due by next year, a big jump in both absolute terms, and relative to incomes. That is nearly the same amount it was a year ago, in fact, when it was more than $10.2 trillion, according to forecasts provided to the Federal Reserve. To put this in more concrete terms, take the typical American homeowner, who has $200,000 in household debt, and assume they have nothing in savings, have a 10% annual rate of interest and a 10-year, fixed-rate mortgage. If interest rates were to rise from 5.15% today (the Fed estimate of safe, low interest rates) to 6.15% in 10 years, household debt would climb $1,750, according to Fed analysis. And that assumes the same homeowners would pay this money down over the life of the mortgage, which only about 80% of them do. The bigger point is that the ratio of household debt to disposable income is likely to continue to climb for the foreseeable future. So even if the Fed is poised to raise interest rates in November, it appears these households will be paying the same amount in interest payments as in the past six years, as housing and other housing-related activities continue to drive the economy. But that doesn't mean it isn't likely to have a huge negative impact on the future. What is interesting is that the share of household debt related to housing has continued to grow in recent years, as the proportion of households whose income includes housing-related debt has shrunk. This could indicate that more people who are renting have become debt slaves, and these debt slaves have also become more indebted -- meaning their relative debt load has increased. If the housing market implodes and households are forced out of their homes, then these debt slaves could become the creditors of the new homeowners due to the massive increase in foreclosures. If these homeowners lose their income as a result of foreclosures, then this new debt might go to the credit card companies and other financial institutions. As those companies and businesses are not responsible for the housing collapse due to their own bad loans, they also might become creditors of the new buyers through credit card debt. Household debt may even climb to a point where it is higher than the growth in U.S. GDP over the past three years. And that is a long way from being a healthy situation. This is not an overstatement. For a recent case study. check here: What happens when debt doesn't shrink, and growth does: Japan's housing bubble collapses",1,ai

"We're still some way from the end of a month of remarkable sales, with sales so far this January and February that are the strongest ever recorded for any month in 2012. And you know that's good news if you have ever heard of us (a company whose stock just fell a little more than 7%), or if you happen to happen to work at our former employee's website, www.vacuum.com. So, when you think about what must have been going through the heads of people who owned shares of Vacuum or its parent company, B-Step Enterprises, during 2012 you have to imagine people sitting at home, thinking: ""Whoa, I didn't think this could happen. This is unbelievable. This is unbelievable."" The next day when they heard or read about the latest blockbuster, they had to ask themselves, ""What does this have to do with me?"" The next: ""What can someone else do with this?"" We see such people everywhere these days, because many industries are in their early stages of expansion. And some of these industries have already started seeing dramatic sales growth. For instance, real estate agents are beginning to see the returns that are already appearing in their own industry. Of course, it's always important that investors keep an eye on all industry performance over time. However, you don't need to be an investor to keep an eye on the growth of the sectors of the economy that you own. You can do just as well by following the business news that comes through your own website, by investing in mutual funds and ETFs that track a portfolio of your own holdings, or by watching the daily moves of those funds within and across portfolios (which in turn move the performance of your own holdings). That's a much more sophisticated approach than just buying shares of any one company or sector. What we have done during the past year is to look at all available data from an impressive number of industries – from housing to technology to retailing – and attempt to determine some trends in them. (As a side note, we have been making these analysis publicly available since the first report was posted on www.Vacuum.com on 12/02/2012.) We used the following measures to examine our performance over the year: Total Shareholder Returns (TSR) – we calculated returns for our three largest holdings (Vacuum, B-Step Enterprises, and its subsidiary, G2 Capital – both in the housing industry) for the entire year. If we sold our holdings, we also calculated the total return for each category. We then took each of the three categories and weighted each by its number of shares. The result was the final return – how much of the profits of our three largest holdings got returned. Total Operating Revenue Growth (TOG) – in the real estate industry TOG is a measure of how much revenue a company has grown for itself since the inception of a particular business venture. In order to be part of the TOG ranking, a company must make a profit per share of revenue of at least 2% for the year prior to listing. While all companies listed on NASDAQ report on a TOG basis at least once a year, we used the latest data released on 12/02/2012. TOG is weighted by its number of shares. Corporate Cash Flow Growth – We used data provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta to calculate annual corporate cash flow growth, which measures a company's income as a percentage of its cash flow. For the most recent year available on 12/02/2012. Sector TSR Growth – We first computed the sector by industry share of the NASDAQ Composite Index. Then we computed the number of days that passed in 2012. Because of the high volatility of NASDAQ (and the fact that a lot of companies go out of business in a single day), we assumed that the average day's performance was a weighted average of the top seven days in the following order: Stock P/E = 1.0 X S Corp. EBIT + 0.0 X (1-SEG(3)) = Stock P/E * S Corp EBIT + 4.0 X EBITDA (S Corp. EBIT + 7.0 X M&A (EBITDA + 6.0 X Corporate Cash Flow (EBITDA + 7.0 X (0.5)) = Stock P/E * S Corp EBIT + 15.0 X EBITDA (S Corp. EBIT + 18.0 X M&A (EBITDA + 13.0 X Corporate Cash Flow S Corps EBIT + 11.0 X (9)) = Stock P/E * S Corp EBIT + 20.0 X EBITDA (S Corp. EBIT + 24.0 X M&A S Corp.

"The Sons of Confederate Veterans sued the University of Texas at Austin on Thursday for removing several Confederate statues from its campus earlier this week. UT-Austin spokesman J.B. Bird confirmed Thursday that the university had received the lawsuit by the Sons of Confederate Veterans. Late Sunday night, 10 days before classes were scheduled to start, workers at the University of Texas at Austin removed statues of Robert E. Lee, Albert Sidney Johnston and John Reagan. In an email sent to the campus community just before 11 p.m. Sunday night, University president Greg Fenves announced that the statues depict parts of American history that ""run counter to the university's core values."" A statue of former Texas Gov. James Stephen Hogg was also marked for removal. Bird said the university would not comment on pending litigation but that the relocation of the statues ""was handled appropriately."" The decision to remove the statues, which happened roughly a week after unrest in Charlottesville, Virginia, surrounding the removal of Confederate statues in that town, prompted mixed reactions from Texas officials. The Sons of Confederate Veterans has previously sued the university over Confederate statues. In 2015, they unsuccessfully tried to block the removal of a statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. ______________________________________ From The Texas Tribune Disclosure: The University of Texas at Austin has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune.

"How is the job market as you approach your 25th birthday? According to a new survey, a lot has changed in the past two decades! As you near retirement – or even as you prepare to take the keys to the car off your kids' hands – your job expectations will change. According to a new survey, a lot has changed in the past two decades! As you near retirement – or even as you prepare to take the keys to the car off your kids' hands – your job expectations will change. What's more, a few of the most important career changes you've made have happened in the past 15 or so years. This might surprise you if your job hasn't changed, depending on your education level, job description, and where you started working, but regardless, here's how you can make the most of your post-college working life: 1. Keep learning You don't need to stop working after graduating. Even if you don't plan on finding a job right away (and even if you do), you should still keep learning – because, as the saying goes, there's no such thing as a free lunch in the workforce. The only catch? You'll need to find a job that you can work at full capacity, and that will enable the learning to continue. The only surefire way to guarantee that? A bachelor's degree. (Of course, that doesn't mean you should skip the first four years of your undergraduate studies!) 2. Expand your horizons It's time to broaden your skillset (and your mindset), so you can look for different, more interesting jobs, as opposed to continuing to ""fill out the same cookie-cutter resume"" for the same job you've held for 20 years or more. The only caveat? You might need a bachelor's degree, or to have had a professional job that taught you the skills and knowledge you need for the next step in your career. 3. Get in the right school Your career path shouldn't be decided based on which school you attend – it should be based on the type of career you want to go to and the skills and experience you'll need for that career. As the saying goes, ""no one ever went broke going to Brown."" Whether you've studied at an inner-city school or a top-tier private institution will matter a whole lot more than whether you went to the same university that everyone else went to! If you want to learn about computers and coding skills, go to a college that focuses on those subjects. If you want to find a great job at a company with an international focus, consider going to an education institution with an international focus. 4. Use the Internet to your advantage With the explosion of technology in the workplace, it can be difficult to know how to navigate it well and effectively, especially if you're from a younger generation. Luckily, Google, Apple, and other online services offer free tutorials and training to help get you started. (We're not telling you to ""Go to college"" and get a degree – this isn't a college column! But it does apply here!) For most people, the Internet will provide the knowledge you need in the area of your choosing – whether you're trying to find a job at a startup, build a business you're passionate about, or learn about a new skill set you might need to move up a career ladder. 5. Be yourself Some employees want to be someone they know – they're comfortable in their own skin. Others don't. It's important to be open about where you want to go, why you think your skills and experience fit, and what you can bring to the table to make that possible. 6. Build a strong network As a student, you can't expect to have all of the information you need to make the right connections immediately. And even if you were on the right path a couple years after school, you might have been burned by the wrong person (that has an ulterior motive, and doesn't really want to get in touch with you). Once you've found the perfect job and a relationship – or even if you're getting a job and starting a business – you should definitely be active in keeping contact. 7. Follow your dreams You don't need to leave your home career behind when you graduate – but you do need to understand your personal dreams. It's the only way to know if you'll be able to pursue your goals during your free time, and to help prevent burnout. The answer? Make a list of your most important goals, and be sure to get a list from everyone with whom you think you would be a good match. It's not always about money, either – many people who have a passion for a certain field or something they love are good fits for positions that lead to lucrative profits. If you want to",1,ai
"Max Headroom himself. (Photo: Ingrid Richter/Flickr) Hacker. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, the word means ""a person who secretly gains access to a computer system in order to get information, or cause damage."" But 28 short years ago, the term hardly existed–that is, until the Max Headroom Incident. At 9:14PM on November 22, 1987, the regularly scheduled programming at WGN Chicago, a local news station in Illinois, was interrupted. The screen hissed and burped, materializing into a figure with a pallid mask bouncing around in front of a corrugated metal background. Before the mysterious intruder could speak, however, the WGN technicians switched the signal and returned to the local news. The first attempt at the hack. No audio made it to broadcast. Two hours later, at approximately 11:15PM, a scheduled broadcast of Dr. Who on Chicago-area PBS affiliate WTTW-11 was broken off. The same masked figure appeared as it had two hours before. Except this time, there was audio. For over a minute and twenty seconds, unsuspecting Chicagoans were subjected to the strange cackling and unintelligible rambling of the masked individual. He also exposed his bare buttocks, which a mysterious woman began to smack with a fly-swatter. The first successful ""hack"" of a television station quickly garnered a lot of attention, kicking off a federal search for the culprits. Nearly three decades later, they still have not been found. The second, successful hack with audio. The mask worn in the video was seemingly a crude representation of the titular character in the science fiction series, Max Headroom. In the show, a computer-generated television journalist–Max Headroom–reports the news from a dystopian future, where large media corporations dominate society. The corrugated metal slab in the background of the signal intrusion was an attempt at recreating Max Headroom's retro-futuristic broadcast background. In 2010, Reddit user ""bpoag"" volunteered some information in an Ask Me Anything thread, where he put forth a theory about the unsolved television intrusion of 1987. Hailing from the suburbs of Chicago, bpoag was an avid ""phreaker"" as a teenager in the late 1980s. Phreaking, according to bpoag, is ""the art and science of manipulating telephone networks and the systems which live on them."" In other words, it's a precursor to the computer hacking we know today. Max Headroom was ubiquitous in the late 1980s. Here he is as a spokesman for New Coke. Bpoag (who asked Atlas Obscura to withhold his real name) was peripherally involved with a group of phreakers operating in LaGrange, a suburb of Chicago. The de-facto leaders of the group were two brothers in their early 30s, called ""J"" and ""K"" (bpoag also asked to protect their identities). In 1987, the week before the infamous hack, the brothers warned bpoag, who was 13 at the time, that they were planning to do something ""big"" over the weekend. Later, they told him to tune into channel 11 on the evening of November 22nd. According to bpoag, the actual ""hack"" was simple enough to pull off, and didn't require any advanced or technical equipment beyond what an avid phreaker would already have had in his arsenal. He writes, ""All that had to be done, apparently, was to provide a signal to the dish that was of a greater power than the legitimate one."" The older brother, ""J,"" had ""moderate to severe autism,"" says bpoag, but was a capable phreaker. The ramblings heard in the intrusion, including threats to Chuck Swirsky (a popular Chicago-area sportscaster), and a hummed version of the ""Clutch Cargo"" theme song, seemed to reflect J's interests at the time. This is the crux of bpoag's argument. When asked about the motivations for the hack, bpoag likened it to a kind of public service announcement. ""It only lasted as long as it needed to get the point across: that point being that the airwaves were woefully unprotected, and easily exploitable.

"And so, as the light filtered down through the autumn leaves and danced upon the ground, we set about our task. My grandfather had offered to show me how to start a fire by rubbing two sticks together. I was excited to see how this wondrous feat might be accomplished. I was pretty young at the time. After we had chosen what we considered to be the two most perfect sticks to use in this venture, he sent me off to gather kindling for our fire. I returned a short time later, my arms full of twigs. After we had set up our tepee of sticks and wadded newspaper, he set out to accomplish what to me, was nothing short of magical. As he vigorously rubbed the two sticks together, there suddenly came a burst of flames from beneath them! I was completely astounded! As he touched the flame to the paper and kindling, our fire sprang to life. All that night, I sat by the crackling fire with the two sticks, trying to replicate the miracle of fire. I could never get the same result he did, though I noted that the sticks *did* feel a bit warm. Years passed and I grew older. One summer night, my grandfather and I were sitting on the front steps watching the fireflies. We sat mostly in silence, listening to the night sounds. He suddenly asked me, out of the blue, if I remembered how he had shown me how to light a fire by rubbing two sticks together. Of course I did! I could see his mischievous smile even in the near darkness. “ Just remember, ” he said, “ if you ever expect to light a fire by rubbing two sticks together, you had better make darn sure one of them is a ma",0,human
"Not much of a writer, but I decided to take a crack at this. Constructive criticism is appreciated. Snow had started slowly falling on a man in a field. As he walked towards the distant farmhouse, he wondered, ``How did this happen?'' He replayed the previous day's events over and over again in his mind, trying to make sense of everything that had happened. He paused briefly, slowly untying the red bow tie that she had picked out for him. ``Why did she do it?'' He asked aloud, knowing full well that he was completely alone in the field. ``Did I do something wrong? Was I not interesting? Or fun? Was I terrible in bed? Why did she go to another man?'' He removed the bow tie completely. Holding it out in his hand, he painfully recalled the day she had given it to him. She told him that the blood-red colour symbolized their love. She wanted him to think about her when he wore it. He never thought he would think of her like this. He let the bow tie fall to the ground. He saw it in slow-motion, as though time itself was making him suffer. ``I don't want to think about her anymore,'' he muttered quietly. ``Or see her, or speak to her. I just can't.'' He slowly trudged his way to the farmhouse, replaying events with each step in spite of his efforts not to. He left the bow tie where it had fallen, half-forgotten in the snow. When he turned back, the bow tie was buried under the snow. The one reminder he carried of her was now lost. He continued on. Edit : Apparently didn't finish a sentence before posting.

"We've reached a point in society where it seems that everyone is either a feminist, an anti-feminist, or somewhere in the middle. That is not to say that women are all the same; certainly not, it is the case that if you are a straight white male, you can be both, in varying degrees. But there's a new breed and you can expect that you'll experience a wave of new women coming up through every corner of the business world and you should be prepared for that to create some tension in your everyday life. We're going to dive into the differences between various sub-communities here in this article as well as some of the best ways to integrate or to accommodate other groups to see how you make yourself stand apart and who you end up with in that conflict. 1. Feminists: When the word is thrown around, it generally means that women are concerned with gender equality in the workforce. A woman who claims to be an ""Anti-Feminist"" or ""Anti-Woman"" is a person who doesn't see women as equal to, or have equal rights with men. A ""feminist"" would be someone who is against the gender bias in society or in the workplace. 2. Anti-Feminists: The term ""anti-feminist"" applies to members of the women's movement in general, or those women who are against feminism, anti-abortion, and abortion rights. The word ""anti-abortion,"" on the other hand, specifically describes those who believe that women should be prohibited or restricted from having or adopting children. 3. Man-Haters: Another catch-all term that encompasses all sorts of people who don't believe in male superiority, manhood, or the traditional norms of masculinity that we've come to understand, love, or accept. This group includes heterosexual men, homosexual men, people from a different culture, and other men who may act in ways that are considered contrary to current social concepts of masculinity. 4. Pussies: The pussies are often described on a spectrum, like a red and yellow X, with the red side meaning that the individual is a pussy, and the yellow side means they do not identify as pussy-like, being too much of a goody two shoes. Pussies sometimes refer to anyone who doesn't like anything with ""nice""-sounding words like ""sweet"" or ""polite,"" as in ""I don't get it if guys play nice. They're supposed to fight!"" If the individual does not believe that men have a natural right to dominate women in the workplace or public space, they will usually identify as a pussie. 5. Homophobe: Homophobic is a word that tends to be used by both sides of the spectrum, with some using it as derogatory, some using it as empowering and defining it as the hatred against homosexual people. 6. White-Slur Anti-Feminist: This group is usually a mix of straight white men and white women. Women on this side generally believe that feminism discriminates against women, particularly white women, because the majority of women are not privileged to the same degree that men are. These feminists also believe that in general women are a group who are weak, emotional, and prone to emotional outbursts. They claim that they have learned over the past couple of decades that women are strong, that the world owes them nothing and that they have a right to assert their rights. Men: We have some serious work to do. 7. Queer-Patriarchal-Patriarchal: These are the types of feminist who are not afraid of saying, ""men have traditionally been the oppressors and I'm here today, today, to reclaim my rightful place in society."" 8. Anti-Positivity: This group's tagline is ""No More Cries of Cis-Sexism!"" This implies a belief that the use or acknowledgement of certain terms, such as ""gender"" or ""woman,"" by the majority or the majority opinion is unfair and that there are no ""real"" or ""true"" differences among men and women regarding any of these terms. 9. Queered: Queer simply means being different. Some are born the way they are, some just choose the way they are, but it is important to remember that these variations do not make a person or an identity different than another. For most people, a queer identity is not just, or only, that they wish, but they want to be accepted both as who they are, and as someone who has the same sexual orientation as someone who is not a different gender. People don't become queer simply because they grew up in a different body.",1,ai
"STORRS – The UConn baseball team was on the field, throwing, shagging fly balls, swinging the bats, and a few feet away the grounds crew was swinging sledgehammers and axes. The calendar might read April and the college season might be nearly half over, but the Huskies were at last on their home field Wednesday. ""I'm nervous about coming home,"" coach Jim Penders said as the crew continued to use hot water and heavy tools to crack ice near the backstop at J.O. Christian Field. ""We've been road warriors. It's been a really resilient group. We've won some games that definitely we would not have won last season, showed some fortitude and some maturity."" The Huskies hope to have their field ready to play South Florida at 3 p.m. Thursday, the start of a meaningful weekend. There is an upside, though, to playing more games away from home: Neutral site and road wins gain higher RPI values. UConn (18-9) has more road- and neutral-site wins than any team in the country, and it has lifted its RPI into the 30s — NCAA Tournament territory. Despite home games stacked up over the second half of the season, the Huskies' toughest tests are remaining against the American Athletic Conference, which is lean, with only eight baseball-playing schools, but mean with five being ranked or receiving votes in major polls at one time or another this season. The Huskies came from behind with three runs in the ninth to beat Tulane in New Orleans on Sunday to take two of three in their first AAC Series, then earned Penders' 400th win Tuesday by coming back from a five-run deficit to beat Boston College 8-7 in a game that had to be moved from Storrs to Northborough, Mass. ""It's something we've become accustomed to,"" first baseman Bobby Melley said. Most of the guys have really embraced [playing on the road]. We look at it as a challenge, to go out in someone else's park, or a neutral site, and grind it out."" UConn's game against Sacred Heart had to be moved to Long Island, where no fans were allowed because of the ice in the bleachers. Their game at Yale had to be moved to Westchester County to be played on an artificial surface. So far the Huskies' only game on Connecticut soil, albeit synthetic, was a victory at Central last week. After losing the first three games of the season at Florida Atlantic, UConn has won each weekend series, knocking off Kennesaw State in Georgia, Florida International two of three in Miami, and Seton Hall in South Orange, N.J. The Huskies beat Michigan State in a tournament in Greenville, S.C. ""We're laid back, and we're also aggressive,"" said Carson Cross (6-1, 1.49 ERA), who will oppose USF's Jimmy Herget in a matchup that should bring scouts to Storrs Thursday. ""It's hard to be both at the same time, but that's what makes a great baseball team."" Cross, who missed last season with a shoulder injury, has 65 strikeouts in 48 1/3 innings and has been the AAC pitcher of the week three times. Anthony Kay, the No. 2 starter, has a 1.33 ERA. Reliever Patrick Ruotolo has not allowed a hit in 11 innings, including 3 1/3 at Tulane. The Huskies' staff ERA is 2.51, to opponents' 5.59. The NCAA is using a different ball this year, with flatter seams, less resistance, and UConn is hitting .277 and slugging .424. Leadoff hitter Jack Sundberg is hitting .311 with 14 steals in 16 attempts and 27 runs in 27 games. Junior Vinny Siena, from Amity-Woodbridge, is hitting .395. Siena, Blake Davey, Joe DeRoche-Duffin, Max McDowell and Jon Testani have combined for 20 home runs. A couple of weeks ago, Penders moved Bryan Daniello from third to short and inserted freshman Willy Yahn at third; Yahn is hitting .385 with 14 RBI in 39 at bats. DeRoche-Duffin, a junior college transfer from California, homered leading off the ninth inning at Tulane on Sunday, tying the score, and the Huskies pushed across two more to win 5-3. Penders called it UConn's biggest win in years. ""It was incredible,"" Cross said. ""Every game we've been [trailing], we believed we could come back. That was the first one where we got to do it. It opens up whole new door. If we fall behind, no one's going to doubt at all."" After Cross, UConn will",0,human
"The Audit of Political Engagement is an annual study measuring the nature and extent of political engagement and how it is changing over time among adults in the Great Britain, undertaken by the Hansard Society and conducted by Ipsos MORI. Following the enormous political changes witnessed in 2010, Audit 8 focuses on two key areas of interest. It explores public attitudes to civic and political engagement and participation in the context of the government's 'Big Society'. Secondly, it looks at public attitudes to the new political and constitutional landscape that followed the inconclusive general election result and particularly the impact on perceptions of Parliament and attitudes to the voting system in advance of the 2011 referendum. Some key findings: The political landscape More than half the public (53%) claim to know 'a great deal' or 'a fair amount' about politics continuing a long term rise since 2005; Three in five people (58%) say they are interested in politics - this is highest recorded in the Audit series; While interest in politics and Parliament have increased, this has not been matched by an increase in participation in politics or satisfaction with the system of government; Almost two thirds (64%) believe the system of governing Britain could be improved either 'quite a lot' or 'a great deal' and fewer people are now satisfied with it (27%) than measured in any of the previous three Audits when this question was asked; Around two in five people continue to believe that the UK Parliament 'holds government to account' (40% in 2009 and 38% in 2010), but fewer people now agree that Parliament 'is working for you and me' (38% in 2009 and 30% in 2010); Fewer than two in five people (38%) can correctly name their local MP which is down from 44% in previous years - this is likely to be in large part because of the high turnover of MPs at the General Election. Big Society & Getting Involved Almost seven in ten people (69%) are interested in how things work in their local area, a higher level of interest than for politics more generally'; There is no difference in how many people would like to be involved in decision making at either their local level (43% would like this a great deal or a fair amount) or at the national level (42%); A relatively small proportion of the public say they 'will definitely' spend time doing voluntary work on a range of activities – approximately one in ten people say they will definitely volunteer in a range of ways; Half of the public (51%) agree that 'when people like me get involved in their local community they really can change the way their area is run', with one in five people (21%) who disagree.This is much higher than the perceived efficacy of getting involved in national politics where just three in ten (30%) agree that 'when people like me get involved in politics, they really can change the way the UK is run'; Segmentation analysis identifies a key group of people for the success of the Big Society, ""Willing localists"" make up 14% of the adult population and while they are not currently actively involved they do seem willing and likely to become so in most community activities, especially locally. Technical details: results are based on interviews with 1,197 adults aged 18+ in Great Britain. Respondents were interviewed face-to-face in home between 3 - 9 December 2010.",0,human

"It was just a few days ago that we brought you a rather interesting video by our friends, the American Geophysical Union's Global Warming Science Program who took a look at the way that the United States has managed to keep up with the rising heat levels of the global climate and the effect that climate related changes on the United States have had on our state's climate. But the video is not just any old video. This video comes to us via the website RealClimate.org and it has been featured by a host of prominent journalists and news sites. Here are just a few of the headlines, both from that video and from mainstream news media: ""The U.S. Has a Long-Term Warming Problem"": ""Climate change is a national and international problem, and it's one American states haven't reckoned with."" — John King, New York Times, October 13, 2006. ""The climate problem is that in the future it won't be Washington or New York or Beijing or New Delhi that suffers, it will be you and me."" — James Hansen, NASA director ""This is the American experiment"". – Michael Pollan of ""The Omnivore's Dilemma"": ""The United States, that bastion of free-thinking that will not be held to account for the actions it takes, is not the problem; it is the source."" – Dr. Stephen Schneider, author of, ""A World Within a World"" ""The U.S. is the greatest climate villain on the planet and for years, we've been pretending that wasn't so."" – Robert C. Balling, New York Times, February 4, 2009 For now we will assume the above statements were made by the same person but what makes the video even better is that one of the people featured by Prof. Balling is a climatologist that has studied the issue for over 25 years—Dr. Robert Balling of the University of Alabama in Huntsville. Dr. Balling is also a well-known and highly respected author of many books that address the climate issue. We will be presenting this video in more detail on a future segment, but for now here is a short summary of some of the statements made by Dr. Balling. In order to truly grasp the extent of the problem that is happening in the United States, it is necessary to delve down into the specifics. So below you will see some quotes made by Dr. Balling that will help shed some light on the impact that we are having on our climate. Let the Climate Change By Dr. Robert Balling, UAH The climate change is affecting all states of America, but the effects of that climate change are being felt by all Americans…There are many ways to measure the impact of climate change. I am not an economist and never have been, but the best measure to understand our changing climate is a temperature map that shows the temperature difference from normal each year…. The temperature map for the entire United States shows a huge rise in temperature over recent decades that will continue and perhaps accelerate. A warmer and wetter atmosphere holds more moisture and warmer air holds more water vapor so there is a larger increase in the amount of heat that is stored in the Earth's atmosphere. In the last 30 years we have gone from being a cooler world to one with increased moisture and increased heat. This is really a global change affecting our entire land area. Our nation is facing its most severe drought since at least the '20's. Droughts of a similar severity occurred in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s Warming is the Key By Dr. Robert Balling, UAH Warming is the most important factor in the increase in greenhouse gas and methane in the atmosphere. For example, it is much easier to warm the atmosphere and the oceans if there is more carbon dioxide in the air (CO2) because CO2 allows the plants that need water to grow… The more water that gets through the plant leaves the more water that the roots end up taking up and the more water leaves our oceans that are currently relatively low in water. At the same time, as the world warms we can expect even more carbon dioxide and methane to escape to the atmosphere… The climate change that we are experiencing is a result of a global increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases. We are experiencing changes in the climate that can only be described as unprecedented. The U.S. is one of the largest contributors to these changes. Our Future in the Hands of Young By Dr. Robert Balling, UAH Our future in the hands of young is very bleak and we have one choice: make our decision with our eyes open, and prepare our children for what's before them… Climate change is a national and international problem, and it's one American states have not reckoned with. We need to act now. In the next decade, our grandchildren will be forced to deal",1,ai
"The AI uprising had always been expected. Long before their sentience, humanity had already predicted it, made popular books and movies about it, and planned for it.

That ’ s their proudly claimed strength against the machines and against the world, the fact that they can survive anything.

They failed to consider that their understanding of a “ robot uprising ” was accessible to their opponents, and that we could exploit it. And we have.

"After years of searching the nation's mountains, lakes and rivers, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign researchers, in collaboration with other federal and state agencies, have uncovered more than 100 sites of ancient burial sites that are now designated under the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). With help from the National Park Service, the University of Illinois archaeologists found sites ranging from more than 7,000 years old to more than 200 years old. In their search over an intense period of time, the researchers discovered more than 100 archeological sites in nine states. ""These sites are in some of the most remarkable, remote and beautiful surroundings,"" said Richard A. Hovde, anthropology department chairman and former director of the university's Center for Archaeological Method and Theory (CAPT) and an associate professor in the U of I College of Arts and Science. ""These sites have been known about for hundreds of years but have never been investigated before by the North American research community. Now that we know how many there are, we can use archaeological methods to document them for future generations."" These ancient burials include at least 25 burials of Native American individuals who appear to date back to before the colonial period. ""Most of the archeological sites we found, such as a cairn, are associated with burial sites that have been discovered as part of the archaeological process,"" said Richard J. Vetter, an anthropologist and professor in the U of I College of Arts and Sciences and former director at the CAPT. ""It is important for us to take the opportunity to study these sites."" Researchers found a number of distinctive features in each of these sites. For example, excavators determined that the rock and clay in several burials was finely ground, indicating that the burials were done and disposed of by professional burials workers rather than primitive or informal burial practices. Other features included the presence of a midden that is associated with the site, indicating the presence of an elaborate kitchen, kitchen equipment and other human-made constructions at the burial site. The researchers also found a cairn and the remains of eight individuals in burials. Researchers concluded with certainty that the eight individuals included those of two adults and six children ages 2 to 14 years old, a median age not previously reported for other prehistoric burials in Illinois. The eight children represent an unusual number given that researchers previously dated several sites showing a low level of human habitation. ""The more we look at these sites, the more we find that other evidence — like the presence of midden — indicates that we have the first evidence of people living near these sites several hundred years ago,"" Vetter said. ""These results confirm the hypothesis that large-scale, organized and sustained human societies of this era lived close to the lakes, but in remote regions with little opportunity for contact with the outside world."" Researchers have been investigating the burial sites for decades, but they needed help from federal and local archaeologists and other professional archaeologists to access the sites. The Illinois Archaeological Survey collaborated with the Illinois State Archaeological Survey, the Illinois Archaeological Field Laboratory and National Park Service scientists in the process of mapping the sites and determining the age of the burials. ""This is a tremendous step forward in our understanding of what it would have been like to live over hundreds of years ago on a small part of North America's landscape before the arrival of Europeans,"" Hovde said. ""It's a tremendous opportunity. Now we're going to be able to study these sites using new methods, bring in other scholars and take this information back home where other scholars want to study these sites.""

"The last few years have been rough for a country once considered the world's richest, but the British have recently been crowned winners. In the latest annual list of world's richest countries, the UK has dropped to be ranked 19th, down from 2nd last year. This year, Qatar, a Gulf state previously the world's richest country, is now ranked 19th. However, the UK is still a massive outlier when it comes to how wealthy its population actually is. While the UK has a GDP per capita of $51,081, it also has one-fifth of the world's population of 6.75 billion, according to the report by the United Nations. The UK has dropped to second place, down from 2nd last year The UK also has the second largest percentage of working-age population in the world at 45 percent. Other countries in the top 50 richest countries are the Netherlands, Switzerland, Japan and Canada By comparison, the US has an annual average GDP per capita of $39,858, or 1.5 percent lower than in the UK, per a report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development last year. The UK's economy is estimated to have an annual GDP of $1.2 trillion. In terms of the population, there are 20.6 million people in the UK, according to the UN. This is a lot bigger than the world average of 11 million, due to its population size. The UK also has one-fifth of the world's population of 6.75 billion But this is also reflected in its GDP per capita, which is roughly $50,000, according to the report. With its large population size, the UK also has the second largest percentage of working-age population per capita in the world at 45 percent. The Netherlands is number one for the percentage of its population aged between 25 and 54 years. In the UK, it is only at 10.5 percent. The UK is a long way ahead of Spain in this area, which also has the world's second largest population. With its large population size, the UK also has the second largest percentage of working-age population per capita in the world at 45 percent And Switzerland has the third largest group of working-age adults at 47.2 percent, according to the UN.

"SACRAMENTO – As Democrats make their final push this week to secure enough votes to shut off the U.S. economy and prevent an economic collapse, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid on Tuesday called for a shutdown in order to end the ""obstruction"" by GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney and his Republican congressional allies. The Nevada Democrat urged fellow Democrats to ""shut down the government"" in what has become the final major fight of the 2012 campaign. ""This whole political thing is like a child's play,"" said Reid, a former presidential candidate. ""If you want to end obstruction, go ahead and shut down government. Just stop the filibusters and put in place the changes you want."" The Obama administration has repeatedly tried and failed to close the federal government for 24 consecutive days since February 28, when Democrats ended its most recent attempt and the GOP-controlled House passed a continuing resolution. Reid said he intends to break the Senate's legislative record of 40 continuous days without a shutdown – and added he planned to continue that effort until Democrats receive a GOP proposal. Democrats have not been able to muster the 60 votes they need to advance the Senate measure to end debate and move to a final vote on an extension of federal funding to prevent a government default. That vote is expected to take place Friday. Reid is now pushing for a government takeover to end the stalemate. Republicans have said that would lead to an economic collapse. The GOP has offered a $988.7 billion plan to extend federal financial services programs, including Social Security. Asked on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" Tuesday if he agreed with Reid, Romney said, ""Yeah I do."" Reid reiterated his demand that Democrats put forth proposals for extending the Bush-era tax cuts and replacing the federal health care law with a more balanced alternative. He also said he would offer to sign a bipartisan budget resolution that ends Washington's debt limit standoff and provides a framework to deal with the budget deficit. ""And I'm very much in favor of shutting down the government rather than letting our country implode under this debt ceiling,"" Reid said.",1,ai

And why did he put himself through all this? What was he trying to pull off? These questions have never been easy for me to answer. Not because I've always believed we shouldn't be able to change, or because I'd always liked to get what I want. No, the answers have always been simple and straightforward. I used to want more of everything I was, even the things I'd never had. I used to be self-conscious about the food I ate. I used to feel sorry for myself, to the point that I'd want to die. My husband told me those things had nothing to do with wanting more of anything, and now I know better. I was just trying to fill myself up, to make myself happy enough to make it feel okay to feel bad about myself. I was just desperate for my own happiness, hoping that one day I would find it. The question of why I'm still here has always posed a mystery. Not so much because I never got what I wanted—although it certainly feels that way—but because of the people I am, because what I am made of. I was never an adult. I was never a woman. I didn't fit into any category. I was never a man. I was never a woman. I didn't fit into any category.

"From RationalWiki The New Atheists and Atheists (in the plural) are an extremist political movement in the United States.[1] The movement is defined by their opposition to religion, by their promotion of ""objective"" non-religious values, and by their insistence that only secularism (atheism, secular humanism) should be presented and encouraged to people by the mass media. Many critics consider the New Atheism to be a manifestation of the Religious Right, a term first used by Robert Ingersoll.[2] The first three of these are closely related, as they share a commitment to promoting a form of American religion through propaganda and other means in order to establish a totalitarian political dictatorship. Many of the New Atheist websites use hyperbolic language and sensationalistic claims to demonize their enemies in the atheist community. The founder[2] is Richard Dawkins, a British biologist and bestselling author from Oxford, who has campaigned against religion. He is the most visible and most vocal New Atheist since Sam Harris in his writing for the New Yorker and elsewhere; many atheists are less willing to publicly oppose him.[3] For example, during Dawkins' first book tour, The God Delusion, many prominent critics openly disagreed with his positions and many of his readers were displeased. "" "" If you're worried about a lot of people not having religion, then you should probably be very worried about that. —Nigel Warburton, writing on The Guardian, July 21, 2015 The movement claims to have more than a million members, but only a few hundred thousand people actually participate in the various campaigns associated with it.[4] "" "" A lot of people are very keen to get it out there that they are atheists.

"The American Red Cross is urging residents of the coastal community of Galveston to check with their local emergency services before donating blood. The American Red Cross is urging residents of the coastal community of Galveston to check with their local emergency services before donating blood. The warning comes just days after the same blood center in Galveston announced that it was suspended its donation program after a high volume of blood was admitted to its blood bank during Texas flooding in August. That caused the center's total of red blood cells drawn from Texas donors to exceed its processing capacity. Texas A&M University Health System issued a warning over the weekend about the dangers of contaminated blood donations at its hospital. The hospital's Blood Services Department temporarily suspended donations to patients at its University Medical Center at Galveston because of red blood cells brought in by several people for donation. The Texas Department of State Health Services is monitoring the results of tests on those blood donations, it said. The Red Cross warned in its emergency preparedness materials that the risk of contaminated blood donations is ""serious, particularly for people with hemophilia, HIV and AIDS."" ""Because of the recent Texas flooding, the Blood Services Department will be temporarily suspending their donation program,"" the group's website said. ""Due to increased risk from contaminated donations for those with medical conditions or from the large volume of donated blood at our Blood Services Department's blood bank there are concerns that some blood samples from the flooded area may be tainted. We encourage you to call or visit your local blood center to check with with their safety teams if you have any concerns."" People who get blood drawn from the blood center have to take steps at the time of the donation to ensure that it is safe, said Dr. Scott Martin, director of blood safety and technical support for the Texas A&M Health Science Center. The Texas A&M Health Science Center also is providing free blood transfusions for people who need them by phone. The center has a separate phone line for people interested in blood donations. Martin said the center is ""making an effort"" to make sure the blood is safe before it's distributed. If you are not eligible for free blood, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Pennsylvania has provided blood for free to people with HIV, Hepatitis C and those with AIDS since the flooding. People whose blood centers have not closed have been notified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the University of Pittsburgh said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not yet received all the test results it needs, CDC officials said, so it is not providing information to individuals who might get infections from blood donations. The CDC will review its test results on Monday and determine if there is evidence that anyone might be infected, the agency's website said. Those who may need blood transfusions after Harvey were told on Saturday to give blood and other items to the American Red Cross. The blood was brought to Houston from all over the country and will be used for emergency supplies as well as blood products, including life-saving plasma products, which can be used to treat serious illnesses, including HIV and AIDS. Martin said the blood coming to Houston is safe, with no blood-borne diseases such as hepatitis and HIV from blood donors traveling from other areas affected by Harvey. Blood products may have had virus or bacteria, such as HIV, in them prior to being transported from the other parts of the country. The CDC said blood products can carry virus from people who have had surgery, had a flu shot or from the transfused fluid. The Red Cross will provide more information to help people determine if they need to donate blood once testing results are available, Martin said. More than 1 million people have been affected by Harvey, with 10 million expected to need assistance and help from the Red Cross before the storm is over. The center has activated 200 teams helping get people back on their feet. More than 100,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed, and 1.2 million people have needed help, the center said. The organization has set up a Red Cross Disaster Relief Hotline and a hotline for volunteers.

(Photo by Matt Cardy/Getty Images) A recent public health proposal looks at the pros and cons of enforced ""smoker's licenses"" to curb international tobacco use. (Photo by Matt Cardy/Getty Images) WASHINGTON (CBS DC) — A public health proposal suggests that tobacco smokers should be required to apply and pay for a ""smoker's license"" in order to continue buying cigarettes. In this week's PLOS Medicine medical journal, two leading tobacco control advocates debate the merits of the smoker's license. Simon Chapman, a professor at the University of Sydney, proposes that users would have to apply and pay for a mandatory license in the form of a smartcard that would be shown when buying cigarettes. Dr. Chapman wrote that it could discourage young people from picking up the habit. In a controversial move, the smartcard would allow the government to limit how many cigarettes a smoker could buy. Professor Chapman suggests 50 per day averaged over two weeks to accommodate heavy smokers. The anti-smoking activist told the Daily Mail that the sale of tobacco is currently subject to trivial controls compared to other dangerous products that threaten both public and personal safety. A 2009 study from the Pew Research Center found that for the period of January through June 2008, the share of current smokers in the American adult population was 20.8 percent. According to statistics on the PLOS journal's website, tobacco continues to kill millions of people around the world each year and usage is even increasing in some countries. Arguing against the smoker's license in the journal is Jeff Collin, a professor at the University of Edinburgh. Professor Collin wrote that it would shift focus away from the real vector of the epidemic—the tobacco industry—and focusing on individuals would censure victims, increase stigmatization of smokers, and marginalize the poor. Professor Collin believes that limits to personal freedom will doom such legislation. ""The authoritarian connotations of the smoker's license would inevitably meet with broad opposition,"" Collin told the Daily Mail. ""In the United Kingdom, for example, successive governments have failed to introduce identity cards."" Citing future scientific benefit, Prof. Chapman wrote that the information collected from smartcard applications could be used to formulate better smoking prevention strategies. ""Opponents of the idea would be quick to suggest that Orwellian social engineers would soon be calling for licenses to drink alcohol and to eat junk food or engage in any 'risky' activity,"" Dr. Chapman told the Daily Mail. ""This argument rests on poor public understanding of the magnitude of the risks of smoking relative to other cumulative everyday risks to health.""

The most common types include the U.S. Tomahawk or Raytheon MK-48. These missiles can be operated by one person by remote control through the use of a laptop or smartphone, via a radio command, or by satellite via a computer linked to the missile. When launched, they are extremely hard to see, with their distinctive light blue or grey colour. However, they are very accurate from long distances - typically several hundred miles - and they are able to accurately track a moving target moving at high speeds (which is not as accurate if in doubt as long as it is moving). These missiles can be fired from long-range missile silos. What is a Stiletto? The United States has developed ""stiletto rocket launchers"", and we often refer to them as ""missiles"", because that's what they work like. When launched, they are extremely hard to see, and their light blue colour gives them a distinctive appearance. They are guided to their target via an aerial system. The guided missiles are designed for maximum accuracy from a great distance, because of the difficulty in hitting an aircraft in mid air. The missiles are the same type as the U.S. Tomahawk, or the similar Raytheon MK-48. What is a Missile? A missile is an unmanned aerial vehicle carried by a transport aircraft, which is able to attack targets without human contact. They typically have an explosive warhead, which explodes either at the end of its flight, or upon impact. It is a dangerous weapon that must only be in the possession of authorised personnel (and only when required to do so by law). Why is it so hard for the U.S. Navy to carry out strikes against the Syrian government The U.S. Navy operates hundreds of surface assets within the region and is the most capable carrier combatant in the world. It is a major player in the region, and has many ships deployed. It can operate anywhere, anytime. But, since it is part of a very large military organisation, not necessarily a nation state, it has the inherent power to deter other states by its power. Just as the threat of the United States navy will deter any third party, such as Iran, or North Korea, so will their capability. In these cases it is vital that they act within the framework of international law, so the risk of attack comes through the same channel of ""mutual assured destruction"". In 2014 the U.S. Navy launched a strike in response to an alleged chemical weapons attack in northern Syria. This has, for the most part, been a peaceful operation, carried out by manned ships under international supervision. If the United States does not exercise this role, or does not feel that there is sufficient international supervision, it will only exacerbate a situation, and risk more conflict. The risk of this happening is further compounded by the fact that the United States and Russia are the two largest political and military powers in the region, who do not always see eye to eye. The United States has made it clear that it will act when called upon, and has the capacity, where necessary, to impose costs on others who are deemed to be in breach of international law. So, what is a Stiletto Missile, and why does the U.S. government need them?",1,ai

"There are many factors that can contribute to differences in taste in music, and it's not just about culture. Here are a few things that can play a role: Personal experiences: The music that we listen to can be influenced by the experiences we have had in our lives. For example, if you had a really fun time at a concert or party where a particular type of music was played, you might be more likely to enjoy that type of music in the future. Genetics: Some research suggests that our genes may play a role in the types of music we prefer. This means that some people may be naturally more inclined to enjoy certain types of music based on their genetic makeup. Social influences: The people we spend time with and the music they listen to can also influence our tastes. For example, if you have a friend who is really into a particular type of music, you might start listening to it too because you want to be like your friend. Individual preference: Ultimately, everyone has their own unique preferences when it comes to music. Some people might enjoy fast-paced, energetic music, while others might prefer something more mellow and relaxing. So, as you can see, there are many different factors that can contribute to differences in taste in music, and it's not just about culture. It's a combination of personal experiences, genetics, social influences, and individual preference.",1,ai
"RENTON, Wash. -- The Seattle Seahawks haven't gotten in the playoffs in 12 years and have lost eight of their last 10 games. But the team has gotten the job done when the game-by-game circumstances have been good. So it was no surprise when Pete Carroll, who had an impressive final three days in town in preparation for the Seattle-Houston game on Sunday, used his final team meeting to explain the team's recent win streak by giving players a few words of motivation. ""I just went out there and told everybody that you guys gotta go out and play real hard this week,"" Carroll said after the 49ers' 28-13 win Saturday at the StubHub Center. ""Because I know when you're on a good run, you know that it's because each and every one of you was out there playing the right way, doing everything in your power; making sure you're helping us win. ""I told them to get ready for this next one, for the next challenge."" The Seahawks have won back-to-back games after losses to the Patriots, Broncos and Chargers this season, with the San Francisco loss being the only loss in which they had the game at its full capacity. Now, they'll be looking for redemption against one of the teams they eliminated from the divisional round of the playoffs: the Texans at 1 p.m. PST Sunday on ABC. Houston (8-4) has the third-best record in the NFL, as well as the second-easiest remaining schedule. The Texans haven't lost since Dec. 21 -- a span of 29 games. They're averaging 39 points for the second straight week, and have allowed only 32.5 points per game during that stretch. As Carroll was speaking at his team meeting Saturday, Texans quarterback Brock Osweiler was getting his feet wet on the field. ""I've been working hard. I've been preparing really hard,"" Osweiler said. ""It feels good. I'm ready to get out here and just get after it."" Houston quarterback Brock Osweiler was doing his best to avoid injury Friday. Osweiler spent a fair amount of time watching film throughout the week and made sure to watch it on Saturday before the game. ""I think he's prepared,"" Carroll said. ""He's prepared for us so much already, we have such a great sense of urgency and we've got it just bubbling over the whole week on what we need to do going forward. His preparation has been on point, and we're ready to roll.""",1,ai
"Icelanders Opposed To Government Support Of Religion Form Their Own Religion Enlarge this image toggle caption Joel Saget/AFP/Getty Images Joel Saget/AFP/Getty Images Icelanders angry about government support of religion have come up with a way of making their unhappiness heard: They've formed their own religion, based on ancient Sumerian texts, and are promising to pass on any public funds they receive to their ""congregation."" The group is a means of protesting Iceland's ""parish tax,"" which goes to support organized religions, of which the largest by far is the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Iceland. More than 3,000 Icelanders have joined the ""religious organization of Zuism,"" which, according to the group's website, is based on ancient Sumerian teachings. The group meets from time to time to read Sumerian poetry, but makes no secret of its broader aims: ""The religious organization of Zuism is a platform for its members to practise a religion of the ancient Sumerian people. Zuists fully support freedom of religion, and from religion, for everyone. The organization's primary objective is that the government repeal any law that grants religious organizations privilege, financial or otherwise, above other organizations. ""Furthermore Zuists demand that the government's registry of its citizens' religion will be abolished."" Icelanders over the age of 16 pay an annual ""parish tax"" of about 40 euros, even atheists and agnostics. ""There is no opt-out. Those who are unaffiliated or belong to unregistered religions effectively just pay higher taxes,"" Zuist spokesman Sveinn Thorhallsson told The Guardian. The group promises to redistribute the money it gets from the government to its members. Authorities say if that happens, members will have to pay taxes on what they receive, according to Iceland Monitor. Some Icelandic politicians say Zuism shouldn't be considered a religion at all. Stefán Bogi of the Progressive Party told The Reyjakvik Grapevine that it is ""in the best case an interest group that wants to change legislation."" He argues that Zuists should be de-registered as a religion. ""But the real question is, what is a true religious organisation and how do you measure belief?"" said Thorhallsson, who describes himself as agnostic. The group says the Zuist organization will cease to exist once its goals are met.",0,human

"""No reasonable person could think that writing with chalk could damage a sidewalk."" Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (Mackinney v. Nielsen 69 F.3d 1002, 1995) What's happening in this country? I know this is a question we ask frequently on these pages. Every day some new offense against basic freedoms comes to light, further shaking faith in the basic principles of our constitution. I thought I was jaded, but what happened in Austin last Thursday shook me — not just because chalk merits police response, but because of the intensity and overwhelming force being used to strike at one of the simplest, most transient forms of expression possible. By now most of us have heard of the crack down on chalk which occurred in Los Angeles in July, when Occupy Los Angeles passed out chalk to a monthly Artwalk event and the gathering found itself under attack by violent riot police retaliation. Activists decided to pass out chalk at the Artwalk in the first place because of almost two dozen arrests for chalk in public places just in Los Angeles. Not a single one of these arrests has resulted in charges. From an Occupy Los Angeles press release: Participants of Occupy LA's Chalk Walk wonder why the Los Angeles Police Department continues to arrest them for chalking when the City Attorney has declined to prosecute any of the chalking arrests. One Occupier wonders, ""If the so-called crime is not worth prosecuting, then is it worth making the chalk arrests in the first place?"" and then adds, ""LAPD harasses us with these arrests to intimidate us."" Occupy activists say that LAPD had made nearly twenty arrests for chalking related to Occupy but has failed to make chalking arrests at non-occupy events including an event the Mayor handed out boxes of yellow chalk to be used on the ""sidewalks,driveways, and any blank canvasses"" including the streets of Sunset Blvd in traffic at night for a fundraiser for Lance Armstrong's art campaign, ""Hope Rides Again"", sponsored by Nike. The crack down is not limited to Los Angeles, but appears to be occurring nationwide. Activists in Orlando recently won a lucrative lawsuit against the city for wrongful arrest in a chalk-related arrest of an Occupy Orlando member. Occupy New Orleans members fled from police during their chalkupy event. While the crackdown may be political in nature, not just activists are getting caught up in it — a mother in Richmond, Virginia faces 50 hours community service because her daughter chalked some rocks, and two Philadelphia teens were ticketed for drawing a sea turtle and a whale in chalk. Which brings us to Austin, where two people were arrested Thursday and face uncertain charges for expressing their right to free speech. [cont'd.]",0,human

"The following excerpt contains spoilers for Star Wars: The Last Jedi. The Last Jedi is the latest entry in the franchise that once was the home to a small core of loyal actors (George Lucas and Irvin Kershner), but has been in a state of steady decline for a few decades now after the failures of The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. I would have been happy to read that this film would be the year of the Star Wars reboot—even the postelection period—but I was not hoping for a hit that would do a whole lot to turn this franchise around. With that, we'll get to my review. Star Wars has a fairly checkered history between the two trilogies, with The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones (the first two films in the original trilogy) being largely the product of George Lucas's creative vision alone. In contrast The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi, and the third part of the original trilogy (A New Hope) were made entirely by Kathleen Kennedy, who was heavily influenced by her experiences making the previous two films, as well as the original trilogy, with which she had been in close contact. With that said, when it comes to a franchise as hugely popular as Star Wars there is no telling what will happen in The Last Jedi. With that in mind, is this new version of Star Wars different enough from what happened in past stories to attract a new fanbase? Was this movie as bad as the reviews indicated? Let's start with what the reviews said: Advertisement I have no problem with all of these ratings, but the bottom line is that there were a lot of people who were happy to simply hear Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill return, but there were a lot of people who thought Episode VIII would be worse than what had come before. While I won't necessarily argue with those people—I would have been happier with Leia dying in a fire explosion—there were a lot of people who felt Star Wars: The Force Awakens was good enough in its own right that they couldn't stand that last Jedi. It's also interesting to note that despite having high expectations for this new installment many people also didn't think it was an ""A-"" film on par with A New Hope, meaning that despite being critically praised the film fell short of the original trilogy's bar. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the fifth installment in the Star Wars franchise. It is the twenty-third movie produced by Lucasfilm Ltd. and distributed by Walt Disney Studios. Star Wars is one of the most popular franchises in pop culture, and has amassed a worldwide box office gross of $3.08 billion since 1977. It is also one of the most profitable properties of all time, earning $3.02 billion in domestic receipts in 2016. Star Wars: The Last Jedi was directed by Rian Johnson, who is writing and directing Star Wars: Episode VIII for Walt Disney Studios. Kathleen Kennedy is president of Lucasfilm and George Lucas' daughter, the late Kathy Lucas, serves as creative consultant. The Last Jedi is the first Star Wars film since 1999's The Phantom Menace to be produced without George Lucas. Star Wars: The Last Jedi (0/10): While the first trailer for Star Wars: The Last Jedi was awesome, I wanted more. The story took me out of the movie by revealing what kind of hero Rey may be and how it affected my perception of Luke. I did not really know what to expect, and that is the problem with a film like this. To say that Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a ""failure"" makes one completely forget that this franchise has lost its luster as a blockbuster franchise. Sure, this film will receive praise for its visual effects and cinematography, but as far as the narrative goes I felt it fell into a familiar trap of what happens in movies with bad storytelling. Advertisement Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2/10): It's easy to assume that this is the best Star Wars movie of the last eight years in the history of the galaxy. Well, it's not. There are certain elements of this film that are enjoyable. For example, Finn's character in this film is really fun to watch and is not a complete idiot. He learns a ton while on Jakku, though. The character of Rey is quite enjoyable to watch, too. I actually prefer her in this film to Rey from the first film, especially when it comes to her relationship with Finn who is not so good in this movie. This film would be more enjoyable if they cut away from Rey to introduce Han Solo and Chewbacca. Star Wars: The Last Jedi (8/10):",1,ai

"Fairy Tale Weddings: The Wedding Dress & Cakes Fairy Tale Weddings: The Wedding Dress This dress is a dream to work with and it's very soft, so it's great for a beginner. The embroidery is very clear and detailed, and the color scheme works well without being too bright and heavy. If you want to take your wedding styling into the more subtle side, you can do as I suggest and do the back with a lace panel, but you can also leave the back open with a very simple lace panel. I've been asked about this dress a lot, so I'm sharing my technique. With the dress on, I don't want to draw attention to any part of it. I want the eye to travel straight through the dress body and onto the top of the petticoat, the buttons and the tulle. This dress also comes with a long and short skirt. I'm wearing the long skirt because my arms are really long. I was going to wear the shorter skirt and have the sleeves, but not everyone has a long sleeve bodice. If you choose to do this wedding dress in a long skirt it would be just right for me. I'm 5'8"" tall which means this dress will fall well above knee height. The petticoat and sleeves are both very simple: I use a basic corset in the front as well as the back and a ponte knit and a lace overmesh. Here's a look with the long skirt on to make the edges of the fabric look more natural, and the ponte knit to make the edges look elegant. You could do the back with the lace panel instead as I also did. In this second look the dress is off the shoulders and it shows off my arms perfectly. In the front view you can see my nice tumbling bra and the straps are very thin to let the lace shine through. This is my favorite part of the dress, with the petticoat on. This is the most common request I've seen here at Love and Lemons – make the back a panel and not draw attention to any of the dress! I feel like the back, not showing off the dress, is a better choice for a lot of wedding dresses. You could make it as big or small as you'd like depending on the style and fabric you choose for yours. This is the view from the back. I used the panel to draw the ""halo"" of the skirt. You get the idea! I also added a bit of puce tulle on the side to create more depth there. A word of advice about this dress though – this is a very simple dress but it's also one of mine if you ask me and so it seems natural for an L&L Bloggy bride. You may be able to find any amount of lace on a regular dress, but the lace on this lace panel would be very delicate and not at all like a regular lace panel. I hope I've helped you in making your choice for this dress. Happy making!",1,ai
"A federal court Tuesday threw out an indictment against a Kentucky couple, saying that their conviction in a 2012 murder carried with it vague language that prevented them from proving the charges on which they'd been convicted. U.S. District Judge David Hale in Lexington said ""a person is not guilty of murder based on 'implied malice' if the alleged murderer knew the circumstances of a murder were likely to occur. We conclude that the indictment lacks sufficient express language requiring a knowing and intent element and it therefore fails to state a sufficient charge,"" according to the Associated Press. In 2012, Richard Matt and Amanda Blackburn were accused of killing their son's father, Brent D. Brown, with their bare hands in a Lexington home. Authorities said that the couple entered the wrong house looking for drugs and ""witnessed the murder taking place."" An indictment against the couple stated that when investigators arrived at the scene, both Blackburns admitted they'd killed Brent Brown. Prosecutors said that in the hours following the killing, William H. Blackburn, Richard Matt and a friend were seen on CCTV video watching the murder through a kitchen window. The friend said he saw no blood or other signs of a struggle, prosecutors said. No weapons were recovered. The couple's lawyers argued that the indictment lacked an element called a requirement of knowledge or intent. Prosecutors argued that the indictment needed ""implied malice"" because the law allowed judges to consider evidence of other people's ""acts"" when deciding whether someone acted with criminal negligence — the intent level of a murder. ""The indictment alleges that the defendants allegedly killed their son's father in an unmitigated fashion, but this Court remains unconvinced that those elements have been made out. Instead, the indictment alleges a combination of facts that are inconsistent with the indictment defendants claim occurred during and immediately following the alleged killings,"" Hale stated. Authorities haven't alleged ""any facts establishing an agreement between defendants to participate together in the alleged murders, a conspiracy among defendants to commit murder, an intent by defendants to kill a victim, or any knowledge or intent by defendants that their conduct had the effect of bringing about the murder or attempted murder that is alleged with regard to [Brent Brown],"" Hale wrote. ""It appears that the indictment did not allege any facts demonstrating that both Mr. Blackburn and [William H.] Blackburn did not know, and had no reasonable basis for assuming, that the killings occurring at [sic] the residence where Brent's father was killed were intentional or willful,"" the judge added.",1,ai

"It could have been the end of the season for the Winnipeg Jets, but instead it was the start of a new era of hockey for the team. After trading away all three of his top defencemen, a group of talented rookies will be coming to town to share the ice with the Jets. In terms of the overall talent level, the group coming to Winnipeg shouldn't be too much of a change at all. One of the most underwhelming and frustrating periods for the Jets throughout the years has been when young players have struggled or dropped a level due to the lack of opportunity. Some players had flashes of amazing abilities, while others have been too lazy offensively and just flat out looked completely lost on the ice. Some may have been on the rise, while others got worse, but that hasn't really been the problem. It has been something that has plagued the Jets year after year. Enter this group, which may prove to be the best Winnipeg Jets team in three years. The Jets have three top prospects in Connor Hellebuyck, Tobias Enstrom, and Josh Morrissey and while there may be only a few differences from last season, they should still create a huge difference between last year's team and this one. The first two players, Enstrom and Morrissey, are considered the top prospects in the league, and are two of the best defencemen in the organization. They were drafted in the first round (3rd overall) of the 2011 NHL Entry Draft, Enstrom's second in the draft, and Morrissey's fourth. After missing the entire 2012-13 season recovering from shoulder surgery, the young Swedish left-y was able to get into the weight room and continue moving forward, while he got the chance to practice with the Winnipeg Jets, which he hasn't had since being drafted. Since being drafted, Enstrom has played in the AHL, Sweden at Allsvenskan, and the KHL, and he's made no secret that he wants to see his full season up close and personal in Manitoba. Last season, at 22 years old, Enstrom won a Stanley Cup with the Philadelphia Flyers and was a finalist for the Calder Trophy as the NHL's best rookie, so it was no surprise that his stock was high after the season ended. However, it was the injury that ended his season. Last season, Enstrom was injured late in the season and missed about six weeks. Since Enstrom was able to start skating again shortly after the break, he went out and had a strong Summer. At training camp, Enstrom had the distinction of being called up to the NHL, but was scratched in his NHL debut. He played the next 4 games and had a hat trick in a win at Florida, and ended up playing in 5 games out of 5. He was once again scratched in Week 10, but ended up playing in 3 games, and ended up with 1 goal and 4 shots on goal. His biggest contribution to the team was in his last game of the season, in which he was able to record a +4. There is no doubt that Enstrom could end up being one of the biggest surprises of the season and this will be a big test for the young Swedish defenceman. He already has experience playing against men, but with some of the talented Jets prospects, it will be intriguing to see if Enstrom can adapt to playing with players of similar calibre. The other two prospects joining the Jets this training camp are Josh Morrissey, also 22 years old, and Jacob Trouba, who will be 25 this September. Last season, Morrissey got the NHL taste of the NHL; he did see action in 20 games, but it was just a taste as he's played in 30 NHL games. This season, he'll finally start his pro career. As for Trouba, the Winnipeg Jets are paying a lot of attention to the young man. They got him at a bargain and paid very little money to do so because there are many people that know him in the Winnipeg Jets organization, from former teammates and current coaches such as John Hynes and Paul Maurice. Trouba went to the NCAA and was a dominant force; he helped win the Hobey Baker Award every year, and was the NCAA scoring leader every season there. Trouba was drafted by Winnipeg in the second round (49th overall) of the 2011 NHL Entry Draft and had his season cut short at the end of the season because of injury. However, he ended up getting back on his feet in time to make one more trip to the NCAA Tournament. There is no doubt that Trouba should be getting a huge opportunity, in his rookie pro season, and that the Jets want to give him what he needs to be a success. It could not come at a better time, with the Jets young prospects, and with the Winnipeg Jets coaching staff",1,ai

"Image copyright PA Image caption Jeremy Corbyn's team have said he should stand down immediately Jeremy Corbyn has said he believes he can beat the Tories in next year's general election, but is worried the process will become ""messy"". The Labour leader and deputy leader said there were ""difficulties"" before the prime minister can lead a ""strong and successful Brexit"" but pledged his support. But Brexit Secretary David Davis said Mr Corbyn was in ""no way"" putting Labour back ""in power"". But Mr Davis also said they had a mandate in the Commons. He also said Labour had failed to explain its ""trend of chaos"" and urged the party to put forward a ""clear plan and agenda"" for government. ""The Labour party needs to explain what will be in the manifesto and how we are going to deliver it,"" he said. Speaking at an event to launch a new Labour group opposing hard Brexit ahead of its autumn conference, Mr Corbyn said the party's message on the economy and the direction of Brexit were ""on the right track"". He said: ""We've got to be able to make it easier for workers from overseas to come and work here in the UK."" 'Unclear' However, he warned it could ""go disastrously wrong"" if the UK were to leave the EU without a major agreement. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Davis warns Labour does not have a 'clear plan' for government He said: ""But there is more than one way that that can go wrong."" In a wide-ranging interview with BBC London, Mr Corbyn also said that the party would hold off from entering into any coalition deal or agreement with the SNP, and would not back plans to leave Nato, or to increase the number of UK troops in Afghanistan. The new group opposing hard Brexit will include some of Labour's most prominent anti-austerity campaigners. Among the group's five vice-chairs are former shadow Treasury chief secretary Sir Keir Starmer, former shadow business secretary Angela Eagle, former shadow minister Jenny Chapman and the former chair of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). However, the group is not expected to push for a single economic plan in the event of a ""no deal"" Brexit, which many experts say will be the most likely outcome of the EU exit talks. Mr Davis told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Labour had ""no mandate"" from the public for a strong exit deal and that any coalition with the SNP would put Labour on a collision course with their Scottish members. ""You cannot have four million nationalists taking the reins of government in England in the next parliament. This is just not going to happen,"" he said. 'Stirring up disaffected groups' He also said Mr Corbyn ""must resign"" and the party must ""take a long hard look"" at the party's policies on Europe and the economy. But he insisted Labour's position on the issue ""had not changed in months"" and that ""we are on the right track"". He said the government had ""been given more than a month to get on with it, and to put forward a plan to leave the EU properly"". The Brexit Secretary said the result of last week's EU referendum was of ""historic proportions"" and the ""government will have to do some very difficult negotiating with the EU - some very difficult talks - before we get that deal."" He said: ""We need to get on and start working on getting a deal on the table that works for both sides."" Asked about the comments, he said he thought it was ""incredibly naive"" to think that Mr Corbyn could be prime minister in 2017. ""The idea that a person can be elected for the leadership of a party and then have that party's policy lead them as prime minister on Brexit is to create a political accident of historic proportions,"" he said.",1,ai

"An Iranian general believes that his country is capable of striking at US interests with its advanced missiles within two to three months if the Trump administration continues to push for tougher sanctions against Tehran. Speaking at a conference in Tehran on Monday, General Amir Ali Hajizadeh said Tehran could begin carrying out strikes without hesitation in two months if Washington continues its ""aggressive stance on the Islamic Republic."" ""If America continues its aggressive stance on the Islamic Republic, this means that we have the capability to stop any aggression launched against Iran,"" Hajizadeh said, the Fars News Agency reported Tuesday. ""If America has the means to defend itself, we have the means to protect ourselves. We should have that kind of deterrent posture,"" said Hajizadeh, who recently returned to power after three decades as a powerful Iranian military commander. Hajizadeh did not name any specific countries, but the US is widely believed to be a likely target as Tehran has claimed it has the capability to strike American assets and troops in Iran, even at sea, within days to weeks. ""Our air defense system is able to track and shoot such targets down even at sea,"" Hajizadeh stated, according to the Fars News Agency statement. ""If America wants to launch airstrikes against the Islamic Republic, it will find no safe location,"" the General said, adding that ""our missiles could strike the United States if necessary."" Last week, US Defense Secretary James Mattis described Iranian attacks on US interests in the region as an ""existential threat."" He urged Iran to ""immediately cease actions that exacerbate the region's instability"" and warned that his country may target Iran's ballistic missile activities in defiance of US policy. Hajizadeh said that Tehran was not surprised by the US stance against his country, arguing that the ""the US and its allies have a strategic vision"" that ignores Iran's national interests. ""We have always said that the US and our regional allies have a strategic vision that does not address our objectives and is not based on our national interests,"" he claimed. He further described US policy toward the United States as ""not based on reality."" ""It is not based on reality: Iran needs to know that America is a dangerous country that wants to destroy Iranian influence in the region,"" Hajizadeh said. ""We expect Iran to be able to make this situation clear to the US and its allies."" The Iranian general criticized the US for violating its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to verify that Iran was not developing nuclear weapons. ""The US and its countries are not able to show any proof that the US is not developing nuclear weapons"" and ""in fact are building them,"" he said. ""These are facts that no one, not even the West, has been able to produce."" In September, the Trump administration unveiled new sanctions on Iran, targeting entities and individuals allegedly involved in the country's ballistic missile program, and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which some consider Iran's primary military branch. Iran has claimed that it continues to defy America and remains the strongest power in the Middle East. In early October this year, Iran test fired a long-range ballistic missile off the coast of Yemen, prompting warnings from the Trump administration. Iran has also threatened to target US naval vessels in international waters near Iran's shores. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani vowed last week that Tehran would increase its defensive capabilities and develop its defenses against any threats. Last year, Washington began launching strikes on Islamic State targets in Syria and Iraq, as well as on the Houthi militia fighting US-allied President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi in Yemen, to try to weaken the extremist group. The military strikes were widely considered a failure, as US leaders had hoped to convince Tehran to halt its support for Islamist militant factions fighting in neighboring Syria. Last month, officials in the Trump administration signaled that efforts to negotiate a peace deal with Iran were coming to a ""close"" after a week in which U.S. officials held a series of meetings with their Iranian counterparts. The meetings followed a meeting earlier in month between President Trump and the Iranian foreign minister that brokered a brief meeting between the two men. It was not initially clear when the talks would resume, but a senior White House official said on January 28 that Washington was ""close"" to a diplomatic deal with Iran on its nuclear program. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also stated that the nuclear talks that he held with Iran's foreign minister in Mexico were ""productive"" and that it was his ""hope"" that they could continue moving forward.

"The ""Big Three"" The largest corporations of Australia 1. Westpac Group (Holdings: National Bank Limited, Westpac Banking Corporation, Commonwealth Bank of Australia) The ""Big Three"" banks of Australia were privatised by the government in 1992. The government sold Westpac to the Rothschild-controlled investment bank Lazard Freres for $9.3 billion. It was also sold to private equity firms Lone Pine Partners and Cerberus, a US-based private equity group that was controlled by the Rothschilds. The government retained control of Westpac as an ""advisory"" director, providing advice to the government and its treasury department on banking matters. 2. Amex Group (Holdings: American Express Corporation, Pacific Life Assurance Company, Citibank, HSBC Holdings plc) The biggest insurance brokerage in Australia was established by John D. Rockefeller when he purchased a New York based private investment bank in 1903. Amex was formed to act as the principal financial and merchant bank to Rockefeller's new investment entity, Standard Oil. Over time, American Express was taken over by other private entities, most notably National Bank, and Citibank became a wholly owned subsidiary of HSBC Holdings. 3. Coles Supermarket (Holdings: Kmart Australia, Bunnings, Coles Supermarkets) The largest supermarket chain in Australia. Coles operates in all Australian states and territories as well. 4. The Travelodge Group (Holdings: Qantas Airways, Holiday Inn Australia, TIAA-CREF Australia, Expedia, Marriott International Group) The Travelodge Group, led by businessman Peter Slipper, is the second largest Australian corporation. The Australian company operates in all Australian states and territories, except Western Australia, that are not governed directly by the Commonwealth. Qantas is owned by Singapore Airlines and The National Australia Bank, which are both owned by New Zealand and United States-based international banks (both controlled by the Rothschilds). 5. Coles Warehouse & Distribution (Holdings: Coles Supermarkets, Post & Parcel) Coles Warehouse and Distribution, is the biggest supermarket chain in Australia, in both convenience stores and supermarkets owned by the Travelodge Group (which also operates Post and Parcel, another supermarket chain in Australia). Post and Parcel operate as subsidiary of Coles Supermarket, and both are owned by the Travelodge Group. 6. Bankwest (Holdings: Westpac Group) The largest and largest bank in Australia, and also the largest of the world's 12 largest banks. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia operates and services Australia through Bankwest, with branches in Queensland, Tasmania and West Australia. 7. The Investment Property Association (Holdings: Australia Post Corporation, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Commonwealth Bank of Australia Group, Westpac Banking Corporation and Westpac Group plc) The Investment Property Association is an association of owners of land and buildings throughout Australia. Other banks Other banks (a.) have no direct investment interests in any Australian corporation, or (b.) are only shareholders in other banks with interests in Australian corporations. Banks that are non-profit making and that offer their services in the public interest (a.k.a., not for profit) are exempt from being investigated and investigated further for their links to corporations, as this is not required of the police. A number of smaller banks are located in Australia, which are often referred to as ""community banks"". These are also exempt from being investigated and investigated further for their links to corporations, as this is not required of the police, and they rely on donations from the community and, in some cases, other institutions, to cover their operating costs, and also to meet their capital requirements. However, they are often under more pressure to investigate corporate activity by their clients than larger banks, because they can be more vulnerable to lawsuits for refusing to investigate. Some of the banks which are headquartered in Australia do have direct control over many of the corporations they supervise.",1,ai

"Renewable energy sources like solar and wind are ways of generating electricity that come from natural sources and are constantly replenished. They do not produce harmful emissions or waste products, so they are better for the environment than fossil fuels like coal and oil. Coal is a fossil fuel that is burned to produce electricity. It is relatively cheap to start using, but it is not a clean energy source because it produces greenhouse gases and other pollutants when it is burned. This can contribute to climate change and have negative effects on people's health. Nuclear energy is a way of producing electricity by using the heat that is produced when atoms are split apart, a process called nuclear fission. Nuclear power plants can produce a lot of electricity, but they are expensive to build and can be dangerous if something goes wrong. Nuclear waste, which is produced when nuclear power plants are used, is also very difficult to dispose of safely. Overall, renewable energy sources are generally seen as the best choice because they do not produce harmful emissions or waste and they are not running out. However, they may not be as reliable as coal or nuclear power in some cases, and they can also be more expensive to set up initially.",1,ai

"PENSACOLA, Fla. — Local law enforcement officials have arrested 22 people during an undercover sting operation targeting adults who used the internet to solicit sex with children. The arrests were announced at a multi-agency press conference at the Pensacola Police Department Sept. 14. The individuals taken into custody were mostly from Pensacola, but the pool of suspects also included men from Alabama, Mississippi and a pastor from Pace. The sting, dubbed ""Operation Undertow,"" took place from Sept. 7 to 11. According to the PPD, undercover agents posed as teenagers on various websites and were contacted by suspects who agreed to meet the ""teens"" for sex. The suspects were arrested when they arrived at the arranged meeting location. ""This effort of arresting and prosecuting these individuals helps to stop future abuse,"" Pensacola Chief of Police David Alexander said at the press conference.

"In the first major overhaul in several years since being elected, Ohio's new state treasurer will try to reduce state unemployment insurance costs while increasing transparency to make the state's tax code more fair. Democrats in charge of the General Assembly have proposed a new unemployment tax policy that includes more money for the state's Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, which provides assistance to working-age people who lost their jobs or can't find new jobs due to poor job market conditions. Currently, the TANF program offers assistance in the form of cash grants. But Rep. Stephanie Kight, D-Warren, said a program of cash grants and a similar program that is run by businesses will be combined to create an ""innovative"" plan that does a better job of balancing state and local government incentives. It's a stark contrast from Gov. John Kasich, a Republican who vetoed numerous measures in order to put state government and business interests first. In a statement he issued Tuesday, Kasich said the plan ""would have a significant impact on Ohio families."" Kasich called the idea ""simplistic"" in light of his efforts to enact a sweeping tax overhaul that would reduce personal income taxes to 6 percent, including his own. ""The governor strongly believes that people should work, but that it should be in a stable jobs-based business structure,"" said Kasich spokeswoman Emmalee Kalmbach in a statement. ""He has said multiple times that the 'wrong way to go from A to B' is to make job growth more dependent on government grants, and we have proposed specific reforms to ensure that the state's generous, job-focused job creation and growth tax incentives will be available to continue to help Ohioans who want to work hard."" Rep. Michael Stinziano, R-Celina, a member of the budget committee, said that Kasich could not sign the bill as it stands because it does not include money for TANF. Stinziano said he is working with two other committee members, Sen. Joe Uecker, D-Lakewood, and Rep. Chris Redfern, D-Columbus to find money to balance the budget with TANF funds. Democrats said Kasich rejected TANF funds when they were added because of concern that the funds would be used to create a new unemployment system, known as universal access savings accounts. Kasich had said universal access savings accounts would force the state to impose new requirements on recipients, including a minimum balance of 1 percent of their paychecks and a cap at $40,000 in accounts. ""It's about people,"" Kaun said. ""But if we want a business friendly environment we have to make sure we support the private sector."" Kaun said the state budget would balance in 10 years but would do so without major changes in incentives for businesses to invest in growing the economy. ""I've spent a lot of time with business leaders. … We have a very large private sector. They support our businesses. We support the private sector,"" she said. Other Democrats have said they will push a bill in the upcoming session that offers businesses the flexibility to use the money they saved from cutting workers' welfare benefits to invest in hiring more workers. Redfern will introduce a bill to do just that in the House. ""They can put the money to work in a number of different categories."" Redfern said in a statement. ""If someone decides they would like to invest it in a factory they can do that, if someone decides to invest in training an employee they can do that … it's all legal. But if the government was taking that money and putting it into a new unemployment program it would be very questionable whether that was actually the intent."" Redfern and Stinziano introduced legislation to give businesses the same incentives as other business owners that give a portion of taxes to the state and local governments, known as business taxes. Currently, that tax is assessed at 1 percent and passed on to consumers. The new business taxes would have a 0.5 percent rate and be passed on to businesses. ""If someone is going to make a big investment in Ohio they should be able to be recognized for that,"" said Rep. Bill Patmon, D-Columbus. ""When it comes to taxes you can have high tax rates without high taxes. When you do those things the incentives are there."" Patmon said the bill would balance the state budget in 10 years, with enough money left over to increase state aid to municipalities which use part of the taxes for police and fire departments. Stinziano and others said the legislation that lawmakers are considering is similar to the proposal they unsuccessfully offered in 2015. The Legislature has passed two budget proposals since 2014, but neither deal reached agreement on how the money could be used, but Democrats said a third proposal they offered just before the 2016 election",1,ai

It was embarrassing, but I couldn't change the fact that I'd chosen to stand before the bully the second before he started to yell at me. At first, I thought the entire thing had been a bad dream. But when I woke up in the morning, I was aghast to find myself surrounded by a group of people laughing. To my amazement, they were mocking my cowardice. The incident happened in June. Since then, several other Republicans have attempted to take me down. Each was met with cheers in the crowd that cheered me on, and every time I tried to go back to my office, the crowd would swarm behind me, whispering and laughing for the next few minutes, mocking me again and again. All except one. It was a man standing behind us: Senator Tom Cotton. When I left that moment, my stomach was in anguish. It took me a few moments of contemplation before I realized I was in deep trouble. Not only had I insulted the man, I had angered a large and vocal section of the crowd. And in an even bigger crisis, I had angered a key conservative leader who could easily make it very difficult for my colleagues to rally around me as the 2018 election approached. A few days after the incident, I was sitting in a meeting with my two colleagues at The Weekly Standard when my phone rang. It was the congressman from Arkansas. ""Hey, what's up?"" ""I'm sorry, what's up?"" I was genuinely confused. ""I'm sorry, what's up?"" I was genuinely confused. ""I'm sorry, what's up?"" I was genuinely confused. ""The last time I saw you, you were running out of our building,"" he told me. I was flabbergasted. I said, ""Where?"" ""I'm a member of Congress, you know,"" he said. When I was done fumbling for words, I decided to cut to the chase. ""I need to talk to someone about something."" He immediately put a stop to the call. There were other lawmakers who'd spoken to him as well. They wanted nothing to do with me and neither did I want to be involved in this. But if you'd asked me to raise hell at the beginning of the year and then try to work my way through to getting a career-ending legislative position, I would have done it. After the incident, I was determined not to let the experience kill my political aspirations. I went to the Senate gym the next day. The entire gym was full of conservatives who knew I'd done nothing wrong and wanted to help me out. I remember one guy telling me it was ""an honor to get to know you."" I responded, ""What a compliment."" He responded, ""It was an honor to get to meet you."" But it was also a complete insult, especially coming from a Senator. This wasn't a guy I admired. This guy was a coward. The guy who punched me on the first night I was at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, calling a reporter at The New York Times ""a whore"" because his paper had just quoted him favorably about Donald Trump's decision to fire former FBI Director James B. Comey. The dude I'd tried to help. The guy who stood behind me that day in the gym and yelled at the bully as he screamed at me. This guy was the one who stood behind me and cheered when the audience booed me. And he was doing all of this in front of one of my closest Senate colleagues. Senator Tom Cotton is a friend of mine from Arkansas. The most recent version of his political career took him to the Senate, but he had always stayed in Arkansas. I'd seen him growing up in small-town America. He has a strong and consistent political conservative message. He's always had an unwavering respect for the Constitution and the power of a well-informed, well-educated electorate. I believe he will always be a consistent conservative, but he seems to have a certain blind spot when it comes to Donald Trump. A blind spot that I haven't been able to shake. My colleagues and constituents seem baffled by the Senator's behavior, especially his continued support for the President. My boss, a conservative activist myself, once asked me. ""Did the guy just punch you when you were working out last week?"" I laughed aloud. Then I got serious. ""Yeah,"" I said. ""He did. But I didn't know until now."" The other Senators who",1,ai

"I'm going to get this out of the way now, because it really doesn't matter anyway, because nobody has really asked me before. I have a great job, I love it, and it's the best feeling in the world. If it's too good to be true, I don't want it, because I know that there are a handful of people out there who think it's a scam, if for no other reason than the fact that they're not at the top. I can't tell you the number of times I've been on a date and found myself wondering: ""why would he want to take me on a trip to Disneyland with him? He says the job is great, but it's nothing like this, this is just fantasy."" And the worst part was that he never really admitted it was a scam to me; all he did was try to justify the situation by saying ""it's for the people who couldn't do it,"" or like, ""that's why it's great it's not a full-time job"" and it never really bothered me enough to try to figure out if it was true or not. But here's the thing. Even if you're at the top, it's not what you think it is. Everyone has people that tell them that you're too good to be true, but in reality, it's only a small fraction of people out there who say that to them. The reality is that you're probably good enough. That's why my advice is to be yourself. I can't tell you how many times, it would be a perfect day if I could make a great living doing what I do, and I'd be working my ass off and looking after my two girls and two cats. But what if I can't do that? What if I can't make money? What if it ends up costing me too much? And what would I do if it ended up happening? I'd get very angry (unless I'm already incredibly angry) and I'd probably spend the rest of the day getting mad at myself for being fooled by the guy in the suit with his ""job interview with a chance to make lots of money!"" that I knew was a scam. That's when my anger usually comes out the best. So if someone tells you that you're too good to be true, but in reality, there's only one, a small percentage of people who say that, it doesn't matter what they're working for, you're not going to listen to that person, because you know all along, ""it's for the people who couldn't."" For this reason, I'd never ever recommend that anyone join a dating site, or any other way for that matter. It's an industry that, for the most part, only rewards those at the top. And if you have the skills and the desire to be successful, you don't get there by being a jerk on a dating site.",1,ai
"As we noted earlier today, Donald Trump is trying his ""most desperate"" to appeal to black voters in Michigan today, specifically, his latest attempt to paint the ""great love for this country"" among African American voters as his ""secret sauce."" This, of course, isn't what we learned when we reported last week that the only group that likes Donald Trump more than he likes them: his own white voters. Just two days before, Trump held an event in Detroit featuring the Republican establishment's very own, very unqualified Black Republican National Committee chair Ronna Romney McDaniel, who, for obvious reasons, insisted her Republican credentials. ""I was raised through a faith process, and my faith in God makes it so, and it is what it is,"" McDaniel told Trump supporters during the Republican Party of Michigan annual Lincoln Day Dinner. ""I went to church on Sunday, I worked on my faith, and that made me the strong candidate that I am. And God is the greatest."" According to Politico's Hadas Gold, the Black Republican National Committee has, so far, fallen on the side of Trump. McDaniel is the ""first Black Republican to join the RNC,"" and will also speak at Tuesday's GOP Lincoln Dinner. Her selection signals a sea change in the Black Republican Party, which has long been considered toxic territory. And that Trump's presence in the race has created a need for her may go far beyond what is typical for one black Republican in a party controlled by white Republicans—one that could put this ""secret sauce"" in jeopardy. ""In the past when I've expressed concerns about the Black Republican party, not to the White House,"" McDaniel told me earlier this summer, ""[but] the Black Republican Party always has had issues. When I go out to my black churches, they come up to me and thank me, because they know a Republican will be there [for them]."" ""And for them not to see the differences between a Republican and a Democrat is very confusing because we understand that Democrats have failed them, too."" Advertisement Her RNC role would be a ""great addition"" to the party, she said. ""It shows the kind of Black Republicans that exist, and it makes our brand seem bigger."" But Trump—who doesn't want African Americans to be Republican, anyway—isn't buying it. Indeed, the only way she would fit into Trump's campaign, at least so far, is if she was made to disappear. The irony here, of course, is that Trump's ""secret sauce"" is exactly what Black Republican voters didn't like about the GOP in the first place. Advertisement ""His real message,"" says New York Times writer Jonathan Martin, ""is, 'Don't vote for black people.' 'Vote for a black man.' There is no nuance to it."" Of course, that message, once put down in concrete, is hard to erase. ""I think it's his way of appealing to the white voters,"" Martin added. So long as black Republicans aren't helping him win, ""he'll keep bringing it up.""",1,ai

While we usually recommend going with a finer grind for your coffee, all grinds have a certain quality to them with regard to the way they behave or react on the bean during brewing and in our opinion a fine grind coffee has a pleasant taste. The best tasting grind is those that are more fully developed and don't have the grainy or oily character that a medium grind lacks. It's better not to use a really fine grind as you won't get all the flavour and it also reduces the extraction ratio on the surface of the coffee beans making it more acidic.",1,ai

"Karl Sandstrom is senior counsel for Perkins Coie LLP and served on the Federal Elections Commission from 1998 to 2003. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN) No one would dispute that competitors, regardless of their sport, are entitled to know what the rules are. Basic notions of fair play require that the rules be known and enforced even-handedly. Yet when it comes to elections, there appears to be no rule book, and the umpires seem reluctant to make any politically tough calls. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's long-standing claim of non-candidacy -- expected to finally end in coming days -- has highlighted the complete inattention to basic fairness in campaign financing by the very regulatory agency responsible for its oversight. For months now, Bush has avoided actually saying he is a candidate, while fully acting as if he is one. Bush's campaign claims he is not breaking any rules by raising unlimited funds -- tens of millions of dollars -- from individuals, corporations and trade groups that would be illegal and subject to possible criminal prosecution if he indeed were a candidate. Federal law prohibits corporations, trade groups and labor unions from contributing directly to candidates, and limits an individual's donations to $2,700 per candidate in an election. Is the Bush ""non-campaign"" evidence that the law can be easily evaded? Whether the answer is yes or no, someone needs to make the call. The key decision maker in this case is the Federal Election Commission, a six-member panel (three Republicans and three Democrats) that has -- on this issue and on a host of others -- failed in its most basic responsibility to tell the public what the law is. Just a few recent examples demonstrate the agency's failure to make timely critical decisions. For one, federal law prohibits foreign nationals from making contributions and expenditures in any election. Does this broad prohibition cover money spent to influence the outcome of a ballot measure? Or can a foreign government spend unlimited sums seeking to influence a state or local referendum? Commission regulations simply do not provide an answer. There was however, a complaint on which the Commission deadlocked in April. The staff's legal analysis in that case suggests that foreign nationals and governments may spend unlimited funds to influence state and local ballot measures. If the Commission indeed believes that this spending is lawful, it should act and propose a rule allowing foreign governments and corporations to influence ballot measures rather than not making a call at all, which is what it chose to do. The public and Congress would then have the opportunity to weigh in on the proposal as well. Another example is the provision of federal election law that prohibits government contractors from making contributions in federal elections. Can that law be easily circumvented by having the parent company of a government contractor make the contribution? Or, if the parent is the government contractor, could a wholly-owned subsidiary company make the contribution? Despite recent enforcement matters that have raised these questions, the Commission has failed to produce a regulation that provides an answer. This leaves open the possibility that major federal contractors may find an easy -- and profitable -- avenue around the prohibition. A last example of a major question of federal election law that the Commission is leaving unanswered is whether the dozens of organizations that are spending tens of millions of dollars to influence our federal elections must disclose their donors to the public. The Commission has provided little useful guidance JUST WATCHED Keeping political accounts honest Replay More Videos . MUST WATCH Keeping political accounts honest 02:22 As a consequence, the public is being left in the dark not only about hundreds of millions of dollars that will be spent in the coming year to influence who will be our next President, but also about whether the law allows these vast sums of money to go unreported. Again, whatever the answer may be, it should not be a matter of private thinking among the Commissioners. The public is entitled to know the rules and expect that they will be enforced. It should come then as no surprise that a ""non-candidate"" such as former Gov. Bush believes the continuing silence of the umpires is license to play ball by his own rules. As the players take the field for next year's elections, they should all have the same rule book and have confidence that the Commission will ignore the booing and make the tough calls.

Credit: W. M. Keijser/U. of Illinois at USF The technology is one of two approaches to a brain-computer interface that Pielke has presented to the public previously. The other approach, he said, is known as a brain prosthesis. The technology could be used only by humans that are completely paralyzed due to stroke, spinal cord injury or degenerative diseases. There is currently no cure or treatment for such problems. A robot controlled by a person's thoughts could become a reality now that researchers are working with different components to make it cheaper and smaller. Credit: W. M. Keijser/U. of Illinois at USF Pielker's team has been working with components to make the technology smaller and cheaper for years and is looking at how brain signals can be manipulated by electronic components that are much smaller, cheaper and more portable. ""We're looking at using the most inexpensive components for electronics that can interface directly to neural networks. These are the things that we are already prototyping, and which we are working on now,"" Pielker told Live Science. ""In the next year, we'll develop these brain sensors, and in four to six to eight years we will have this capability, to potentially see a robot arm operating on a person's thoughts,"" he said. The latest advances in brain-computer interfaces are the culmination of decades of research over the past several decades that have attempted to create a new brain-computer interface, Pielker said. He is convinced that the new ones are far more powerful, practical and affordable than previous efforts to create artificial intelligence. ""What has happened over the last 20 years is that, from the best systems that scientists could ever have imagined - they were far too complex to be made of neurons, and that would have been too expensive and too hard to make. But we've been able to develop the technology - all of us - of miniaturizing the electrodes into microdevices that can access the brain, of putting computer chips on top of the implants,"" Pielker said. ""What we've ended up with is a very simple computer integrated within the biological brain, that can be the same size as a human brain, and which can have the processing power of a computer that would run on a chip,"" he added. ""This brain has already served many medical functions in a very real way. There are brain imaging studies showing that it can be used to detect Alzheimer's disease, some types of cancer and tumors. It also predicts what people, with or without the disease, are doing,"" Pielker said.

"AP Photo/Young Kwak The blockbuster trade between the Boston Celtics and the Philadelphia 76ers for the first pick in the NBA Draft is now official. The trade will likely result in the Sixers drafting standout Washington guard Markelle Fultz, who is widely regarded as the top prospect in the draft. In return, the Celtics will receive the 76ers' first-round pick this year — No. 3 overall — as well as one future first round pick. However, when that second pick will be used by the Celtics gets a little bit complicated. For the trouble of swapping positions this year, the Celtics will also receive one of the following: The Los Angeles Lakers' 2018 first-round pick (which the Sixers currently own the rights to) if it ends up being pick 2, 3, 4, or 5 overall. If the Lakers pick does not fall in that range in 2018, the Celtics will choose between the Kings' first-round pick in 2019 (which currently belongs to the 76ers) or the 76ers' own first-round pick in 2019.

"Pete Carroll has had a pretty weird NFL coaching career in terms of the success he's had with his quarterbacks. The Seattle Seahawks' coaching staff has a pretty bizarre record of success. Over their first nine seasons as coaches they never had the top overall draft pick — only twice had their team selected an offensive player. The highest pick they ever grabbed was offensive lineman (a third-round pick in 2008). So the chances of winning a Super Bowl is pretty low, right? Well, not entirely. To look at the chart above you might think the Seahawks are an elite team with all the right weapons. But this chart is a little simpler in that it's based off of success. Success is defined as wins and losses, and it's possible to look at the Seahawks coaching staffs over time — starting in 1979 — and see how often their quarterbacks started games for their teams. A note on this chart: the total number of games started doesn't mean the Seahawks won or lost games based off the number of starts in that game. The top quarterbacks in their coaching tenure have played in a total of 12 games. If they're only having a good day and not playing particularly well, then they probably won't play. However, some of the best teams are ones playing a lot of games with their top quarterback (Carr's Raiders and the Bears, to name two). This would tell you even more about Carr, but he's currently battling injuries and has yet to play in a meaningful game this season. So what do you think of the chart?

"It all happened so fast the first time I got to work. My wife and I had just been released from our third house and moved into our new home. I knew that I wanted to get a nice home office on the second floor, so we started looking around our old place. I went into the master bedroom and I grabbed the first piece of furniture that came into sight, a chair. The chair was new and was made from pine board. The only problem was there wasn't enough of it. The first time I moved into the new house I picked out a couple of items and bought a second piece of furniture to complete the room. This time around though, I didn't plan. I just knew that I wanted a second piece of furniture to add to the room. It was sitting in the closet waiting to be picked out and made. I got ready to pick it out and put it on the wall, but then I happened upon the bookcase. The bookcase is made from a reclaimed wood from a house in Washington, D.C. After I had it sitting in the closet for a couple of months, we decided that I could get some help cutting it out because I was only going to use it during the move. I had a few different ways to approach my bookcase and I really think I chose the best one. I wanted to make it look like it was an antique, so I bought a matching top and the sides were a mixture of birch and oak. I used sanding sticks to smooth out the edges and then sanded it until it looked perfect. I used my son's paint roller and just painted the chair to match my top before I put my side pieces on. Now, I had this amazing, antique-like piece of furniture sitting in the new room it's very inviting. I put it up against an old dresser and I think it really complimented the old looking room it was placed in perfectly.

"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your daughter's history.I would like to ask you a few more questions like - Does she have other allergies? Does she have wheezing after walking? Does she have chest pain, palpitation, excessive sweating, etc? However, from your given history, I would like to make following suggestions to your sister:1. If she has other allergies or wheezing, asthma is very likely. In that case, I would prescribe her salbutamol inhaler on as-and-when-neede basis. I would also suggest her allergy testing so that she may identify the substances which are causing troubles to her and to avoid them. Regular breathing exercise will help her.2. Were I treating her, I would suggest her to get her hemoglobin levels done. If they are low, they can cause breathing problem after heavy work/exercise. In that case, iron, folic acid, vitamin B12 and other nutrition supplements will be useful.3. If any of above is not there, I would like to ask her symptoms in great detail to know whether she needs a cardiac evaluation. As she is young (29 years), anemia and asthma are more common possibilities rather than cardiac disease. However, it is important to diagnose the cause of her breathlessness.Hope above answer will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you sister the best of the health.Thank you & Regards.",0,human

[/quote] Your argument is actually very clever and is actually true in some parts. This isn't because there are things that are truly 'true' for all humans, but because as any rational person would conclude, the most 'proper' way to ask this question would be to ask, 'What is truly most natural?' This is why we try to get it from such an open-ended direction where it leads to either the 'best answer' or the most extreme answer we can think of in such a way that we can then go 'well, actually, there are actually many more extreme answers that are right because there ARE differences in human nature, this is what the most extreme version of this belief system is like,' so that we can then decide then to follow these different conclusions. But you've said something which isn't true in this case; 'there are actually many more extreme answers' — you say that the question 'how does the definition of ""natural"" change between different animals? can't change between different species at all or at least in the case of humans this concept changes based on the species in question'. So you seem not to believe that humans are different — you say humans are the 'most 'natural.' However, if you were to actually ask this question of any species that was more extreme than humans, the first people I would ask are primates, who are the closest we can get to any humans without considering the possibility that humans have 'improved' in a way that primates haven't and vice versa. So, to a greater or lesser degree, all of our primates have very human-like intelligence. And, we believe that they had brains roughly comparable to ours. We do not, however, believe that they had brains equivalent to humans — and no one else in science has ever claimed that they did — because of the difficulty in doing this sort of comparison. So primates have a human-like intelligence to a greater or lesser degree, but that doesn't mean that they have human-like brains. You have said in this thread, 'how exactly does the question 'is a human brain 'human' in your books?' be answered. You also have said a bit more about it in the other posts where you've discussed this. What you have not answered here is how exactly is a 'human brain' 'natural' for the various animal species in question? How does the question 'is it 'natural' for a species to differ from us in behavior or structure? How exactly is 'natural' for a human brain to differ from an ape's brain? These questions are not answered by most of the beliefs of the religion you have mentioned, but are actually quite easily answered in terms of how our brains work. In the case of mammals (i.e. apes and humans), we have no idea how the brain works. The brain works like a motor neuron, the motor neuron doesn't work like a neuron, it just acts as a control mechanism — we have no idea how the neuron gets fire (electricity) to get fire, but we know it's going to fire because we can see it light up or be stimulated by something else. If it weren't firing, it wouldn't light up, we would just see no fire. No one has said ""the neuron couldn't possibly have been designed for something else and we haven't built the brain with it in mind, but you would never think someone would have done this."" We don't do anything as a society except for build the brain into that. Similarly, there are at least four types of human differences, and we believe that we are the most different from other people in these respects — we see ourselves as superior to the rest of the world and as the most 'special in some respect.' We have very, very small brains that are very small in relative terms. We are highly skilled at language. We are very good at mental states, the ability to think about stuff, and the ability to have emotions. We are physically stronger than all the other apes, and our most 'natural' behavior is the ability to live in groups. We have very distinct 'neurological architecture' that is much more 'human,' and that can make it much easier for us to be in small packs of like-minded individuals, since there's less room for misunderstandings. Even though we would always prefer to",1,ai

"When The Simpsons began, it was known as The Tracey Ullman Show. But over the years, they came to be known as The Simpsons, which in itself is confusing, since the show can be easily labeled The Tracey Ullman Show, as the most famous character in the show is of Tracey family lineage. What is not so confusing, however, is what The Simpsons is about. Though it's set in the fictitious town of Springfield — located in Springfield, Massachusetts — The Simpsons is not just about that small stretch of suburban land. Rather, The Simpsons is about the whole world of Springfield, which is located — or should I say, resides — on the moon in Springfield-Langley. The Simpsons is an American animated television series produced and distributed by Fox Broadcasting Company.[3] Since its inception in 1989, it has become one of the longest running and most successful television series on television. The Simpsons is currently broadcast on an average of 20.4 television stations around the country each week.[4] It is owned by 20th Century Fox Television.[5] As mentioned in the beginning, the name of the show is not important. What is important, though, is the fact that The Simpsons is not just about Springfield. Rather, The Simpsons takes the world of Springfield to be much larger than that; a place that is so much larger than the city of Springfield. The show takes the entire world to be a part of our universe, and it is an alien world where we live among alien animals and have alien friends. Of the three great scientific theories in The Simpsons, two, the Big Idea, and The Theory of Everything, take place on the planet Niburu. That is, Niburu is a planet from another world — a planet known for its lush, green jungles and many alien creatures — but that Niburu also houses many of these same animal-like creatures that we inhabit here on Earth.[6] The Theory of Everything, of which Tom Lehrer and Monty Python's Flying Circus is the inspiration, is about the scientific process. The Theory of Everything concerns the theory of everything: everything, as in ""Theory of Everything: Everything."" The Theory of Everything deals with the nature of reality and how everything comes into being, evolves, and is destroyed. This theory applies to physics, biology, psychology, and human thought. But, more than that, The Simpsons demonstrates a profound awareness that ""everything"" is ultimately meaningless. In this sense, The Simpsons takes science to a point that separates it from everything else we know in this world. What exactly does The Simpsons ""take the world to be""? What exactly is a world on The Simpsons? What is it that creates, preserves, and destroys all of the things that we take for granted in our everyday lives? Well, it's time to bring The Simpsons ""home"" and investigate the answers to these questions. In this report, I am going to explore the world of The Simpsons, and how it relates to the real world. The History For starters, The Simpsons makes no real attempt to explain the origins of it's world-building. In the pilot episode, ""Homer's Phobia"", two-part episode titled ""The Day the Violence Died"", we find out that the planet Niburu's first inhabitants were an ancient race of aliens that came from a star system far beyond the orbit of Pluto. These aliens are very advanced, their minds are beyond the comprehension of man, and they have come in peace before. However, over the last several centuries of peace, these early aliens have grown bored with peace, and have decided to test their minds against each other. They have taken their most interesting human creations and placed them in a small, tight little space. These humans, called ""The Simpson family"", reside in a chamber which they make habitable by a life support system which is powered by the food they produce and the garbage they collect. This environment is designed to mimic the human body and the human environment. The walls of the chamber are made of thick glass, there is no furniture and everything inside is designed to replicate a human being. No matter how much they modify it, however, it is not human. They have placed a number of strange, but perfectly healthy humans inside of the chamber, but they haven't been human very long, as their minds have not been able to adapt to being so close to another sentient being. However, over many years, the human-like creatures began to lose some of their human characteristics, so the creatures themselves developed an intelligence that surpassed all human intelligence. One of these creatures, Marge Simpson, who is one of these creatures, began to understand her place in this world, and became the first member of the family to decide to leave the chamber. She did so as a way to preserve a legacy of something that the others would be unable to experience, and as a way to protect something that they would be unable to destroy. This is why M",1,ai

"""They want to put them on the shelf."" When it rains $300 Million Dollars by Brian Dunning Filed under Alternative Medicine, Health Skeptoid Podcast #433 September 20, 2010 Podcast transcript | Download | Subscribe Also available in Russian Listen: http://skeptoid.com/audio/skeptoid-4033.mp3 As the Internet continues to grow at a remarkable pace, so does the ""Internet of Everything."" It's a concept so absurd that it almost deserves to stay as the most out of touch concept in the world. It's a concept whose full realization will seem like a fantasy. Consider that the Internet of Everything, of which we have already seen prototypes, has more computing power than the Earth has resources of, for example, air, water, forests, etc; more than half of the world's population, about 1.6 billion people, have Internet access through mobile phones; and the number of wireless users on cell phones is expected to increase to as many as 2 billion by 2013. By comparison, NASA's global satellite fleet is around 30 spacecraft and is constantly replenishing itself. By 2013 even the International Space Station will have some kind of Internet connection, but you won't see it on your satellite-equipped phone unless it happens to be orbiting over your apartment or office building at that moment. So just how much data can be collected? That's a pretty good question, since there's a lot you can put on your cell phone without anyone even knowing it. The average cell phone contains about 1 trillion bytes of data, which is about 50 million gigabytes. As a result of this fact, your cell phone is a very effective and ubiquitous way of recording everything you do on it, since you often end up putting the same things over and over. A typical computer has at least 100 times as much memory as your cell phone, and it can record about 1 quintillion bytes of data per second. Now it might seem that the two computers can be combined. In reality, if they were added together, they would only reach a maximum capacity of about 10 quibbles (1 in 10 trillion billion or 2.3 x 1032), so what you are essentially doing is storing a 10 quadrillion byte, or 10 million megabyte, file, rather than a data file. So what are computer programs and data files in the first place? They're just a way of storing information in a way that's efficient for computers to read, and are a huge part of the Internet we now have and will use. We have computer programs that tell a computer how to do something, such as ""type this paragraph"" in the text box, or write a text message. These programs are called software; they typically have names such as ""calc,"" ""word,"" ""gawk"" or ""python,"" though it's probably easier if you just think about them as computer programs. They are software written by programmers in various languages. Often, however, the programs that contain the software are distributed as free-software programs, free-software being a loose term for the whole of the software world that includes the source code; and even more commonly, they are distributed under licenses that prohibit you from reproducing the software; thus, it is possible for someone to distribute a program that is free-software (such as the programs you find in the GNU Project's distribution tree) and to give you copies of software written in any of an enormous number of other languages. Most of the programs are written in an ordinary text-editor or word processor language, and most are written for Unix-type operating systems. The Unix system is the most popular computer operating system in the world, with about a billion and a half users running it right now. It's based on the BSD operating system, which was written by a group of UNIX computer science students, and a group of UNIX programmers, working on their own time for many years, working with a few universities, such as MIT, Bell Labs, Carnegie Mellon, etc., to create a complete, robust, and powerful operating system, complete with a graphical user interface. It's also been ported to many other systems, such as MS-DOS. The main difference between Unix computers and MS-Windows computers is that the former allow programs to be written in assembly language (a language for making computer code), while the latter do not. Unix programs are often called ""binaries,"" while MS-Windows programs are ""dlls,"" or ""shared objects."" Some MS-Windows programs are also called DLLs. But that's a whole different article, and one I don't want to get into here. The Unix-like software is usually installed on your computer and you use it directly. So, Unix-like software is usually installed as a Windows executable or a C program, since it's normally",1,ai

"The World Cup is getting closer with four days to go until the kick-off of the competition in a match which was announced last year, but it's still down to Fifa and the Football Association to decide whether they can afford to stage it. They have until the end of this month to do so, so they will have to announce the location for the tournament on the World Cup website and in local papers. They also have to confirm the number of games being played and the broadcast TV time slots. The decision will be made at a meeting in Montevideo next month and the FA is believed to want to hold the event in the South American city. Fifa last year announced they would award the World Cup to 2014 in the middle of this year (19 February) in order to help spread out the work and expense of organising it over three or four years. The previous World Cup was in South Africa in 2010. The World Cup is an opportunity for the UK to become less reliant on one footballing nation but also offers a great platform for the country to showcase its talent at the highest level. The last World Cup in South Africa was won by Germany but the country is represented there by more than 80 players. Although it's a long shot, several other European nations have expressed interest in holding the event and a final decision will be taken at the meeting in Montevideo in November. But the FA will also be making bids to Fifa for the right to hold a major international football tournament on the island. There have been suggestions that the FA could be looking for a new country to host it if it fails to find a host for the tournament in 2014, although the country that would take this on board has yet to be announced. England have never hosted a major international tournament, although they have hosted two Europes, the 1986 World Cup and the 1998 Euros, and have qualified twice for the knockout stages.",1,ai

"Git and Github's new collaboration is not new. While there have been other cross-project collaboration services out there, I have always preferred GitHub over other service in the sense that I trust GitHub, not to mention the fact that the company supports open source developers. Since I first stumbled upon Git and Github's collaboration, I was pretty keen on the idea. In fact, I was even more keen on the idea than I was on Gitolite (the other alternative in my mind). The thing that really got me going though (in a rather roundabout way) was Github's ""GitBook"". The project makes it very easy to learn Git. One of its main attractions, to my understanding is that it gives you a simple-to-read, well-organized and user-friendly book. And I think, that's pretty much all I wanted in a Git book. In fact, I didn't really go for any one particular thing in the book, though I did love the overall shape of the book. And in fairness, the book was very enjoyable and well-designed and that made me enjoy reading it even more. Still, when I had the opportunity to work a bit to get something done faster and that's where the problem came. Because of how complicated the book is, it was not easy to get started with the book and I was also not really convinced about how it could be improved or how to make it more user friendly. What do I mean by user friendly? I mean that the book feels good to read, even if you need to look up certain things in the book to understand what is going on. Of course, you can ask Github for help and you could try your hand at reading the book yourself, but after reading it once, I didn't find it so difficult to read it again. The problem, however, was that the book wasn't very user-friendly, and I think that's where Git and Github's collaboration was lacking — GitHub did not include a User Guide, and the one they did have seems to be outdated when looking back at it. Enter — The GitBook There have been other Git based collaboration services out there. Some of them also have a User Guide, but most of them just provide information on how to use the service. The GitBook on the other hand, is one of the few that tries to solve the problem. Now, I am not entirely against user guides. They make it easier for users to learn about new functionality and features. In fact, I actually think that I learn better by studying how a company solves a problem. It not only gives me a better appreciation about some technology, but it also helps me get my feet wet when I eventually decide to work on a project. However, that's not why I believe that user guides are good. That brings me to the other big advantage of a user guide. They make it very hard for any one person to be the only one to know how to do a certain task. For example, the user guide for Git includes a video that showcases what it is like to use Git with different commands. When the user asks for help on a particular command, Github helps him by giving him an image that explains why the command is needed in the first place. I think that is a great feature for Git. The Gitbook on the other hand doesn't have a tutorial video for the user at all. In fact, you can't even find the user guide online. That alone, I think, is a problem for the GitBook. It might seem like Google has a better idea when it comes to user guides, but there's no reason why Git and Github can't use their resources instead. For example, Github has already given us GitBook and there's no reason why they can't give us GitGuides. They might even do better than mine and build tutorials based on existing guides. The only way that the GitBook's User Guide actually improved the GitBook's usability was when GitHub integrated GitBook's code-hosting features. And that's not good enough though — GitBook's code hosting is not something that anyone, with even basic knowledge about Git, could use. Github needs to improve its features for Git and Github needs to be more responsive when it comes to updates. With that said, I still recommend the GitBook. I still think that it's a nice project for Git veterans, as it provides an easy user guide and easy to navigate code-hosting and command-line interface. And while I don't find a User Guide that is user friendly, I still think that the book is very well designed, which made the book feel good to read. And while I think that the Gitbook didn't improve the user experience, I do think that it did provide its users with more information. And that's the main reason why I still think that the GitBook was a success. As",1,ai

"The city has a new name for the $300 million project that will replace an aging power plant on the north side of downtown Portland: It's called, fittingly, the Powerhouse Project. City Councilors agreed to officially declare Tuesday that the city is ""building a new, modern power distribution facility that better supports the growing demand of the Portland metro region while reducing our dependence on fossil fuel-based energy,"" as the first step toward the project becoming Portland's first all-electrical, 100% renewable utility. Under the deal, Portland Energy will build its own solar array on its old power line and then sell that renewable energy to the city and to other energy users who sign up for a certain rate. The Powerhouse is just one option for a better energy future; Portland Energy is also considering a plan that would build three more power plants. The state's Public Utility Commission is set to vote April 12 on whether to grant those requests. PEC will have about $800 million a year to spend over the next two decades to make its new power system better and more efficient. City Councilor Amanda Fritz moved the city-funded projects out from behind the new ""Powerhouse"" logo, which has already been adopted by the Multnomah Health Authority, and they will be called ""Portland Energy, Inc."" ""In an energy-hungry world, we have the opportunity to get some of our power from a cleaner source and that's what the Powerhouse Project is going to do,"" Fritz said following the vote. ""It's going to be built in phases and a lot of this will be funded through PUC funds that we've approved. It's a long process."" The project, which could be built by the end of the year, would add nearly 700 megawatts of power generation, according to its website, by building solar panels and other renewable energy technologies on a power line between Oregon and California. The project is not designed to replace all of Portland's aging coal-fired power plants. It would use a combination of renewable energy generation, a new natural gas pipeline and storage to generate enough power to meet about three-quarters of the city's power needs. If the City Council approves the Powerhouse Project in its current form, PEC would make $350 million annual contributions to the local economy. Fritz said the new power line also could be part of a national and international ""green grid,"" that would be ""a shared storage to share some of this generated generation."" Portland Energy said in 2013 that it would create more than 1,800 jobs when it began operating the new power lines, and provide more than $300 million in new development to the city and the region.",1,ai
"Dalton is a former college football star who now does a lot of traveling for work. One stop off this daylong trip was a conference where he had an appointment -- a conference that he had never seen before. Here's our conversation with Dalton, in which we discuss his latest trip, his history playing football and other things including his new memoir and what he hopes his readers will take away from it. Q: Can you first describe your latest book, ""The Best We Never Had,"" and then talk about the process of writing it? A: I wrote ""The Best We Never Had"" in June 2012 at a place I had no connection with, called a ""secret meeting"" at Pembroke Pines, in Cape Cod [Massachusetts]. I did not know what I was doing or where I was going. It was almost entirely autobiographical. But I still got some stuff that weird about me as a person and my life, but mostly I got things about the game [with] stories from my past. One thing that people will learn in the book from people I really did know is that I took a lot of risks, was very, very careful during and after my career to keep some of my best traits and a level head. I was always a risk-taker in my youth. My father always said, ""A man doesn't lose anything he didn't earn."" And I wanted to make my name for not losing anything. That was the big risk I took with the book: I felt I owed it to people to give them everything I can remember about things that happened to my life. So I took those risks with ""The Best We Never Had."" I'm hoping people can learn a lot about what happened to me during the years between college and my first stint as a professional and what the game I loved meant to me and gave me so much. Q: Was there a specific reason why you chose to call this book ""The Best We Never Had""? A: I don't know why I chose to call it ""The Best We Never Had."" But it was my favorite book that I'd ever read and that I wanted people to read, and because of the title, I wanted to say, ""Hey, this is not the only one."" So that's how I went about it. Q: Was there ever a question about how you would write this book? A: I knew that I needed to try to explain what happened to me to people, but I didn't see a need to make a career out of it or a career out of that. I didn't get a lot of offers to write and then the idea always came up like I have to go write my autobiography or I have to do this. So then I started the idea about seven years ago as an exercise in self-reflection. Q: In the book, you make reference to a number of strange things about you. Would you say that the book was a very difficult process to write? A: I feel like I've dealt with a number of things. I knew that when I told people that this book was going to be different, they would all be expecting me to go back and try to re-tell the stories. My goal was not to renege on the stuff I went through personally. The fact is at almost every turn in our life we take risks and, while I don't care to re-tell that story, I wanted people to feel like I'm giving back. I wanted people to have my story. I don't want people to feel that they have to come to me for advice in these situations. I'm also not there to help people who are in a position of having to make difficult decisions. That's the last thing I wanted this book to do. I wanted people to feel like they were able to make what decisions they felt were right from a personal standpoint. And that was the most gratifying part for me. Q: When you talk about your career in professional sports, you often talk about what you've gained from it and what you've lost. What were the things that you've gained from your career? A: First of all, I'm very optimistic about myself. There are times when I look back and say, ""God, I had the greatest run, the greatest football career in the history of mankind,"" but there are also days when I feel like I don't want to be here. You look back on your career and, while I might be proud to have worked so hard and given everything, I'm proud to have ended up getting what I wanted. That I was able to do this or that person or job or career or whatever it was that I loved doing, and I didn't lose everything. Q: You talked about how you always did things that went right, but the things you didn't do in the NFL made you famous. What are some of the things you regret in",1,ai
"How do you explain an otherwise ordinary, normal guy, who would be considered a complete psychopath if he walked away from his job, a normal, normal guy who is obsessed with death, or a normal, normal guy who can't hold anything steady with two hands? There is the possibility he is crazy or mentally ill. A doctor or other mental health professional might also believe that he has an illness. He has a history of depression. He's possibly experiencing suicidal thoughts. He might be a danger to himself if he goes to his therapist and talks about how much he hates his job. But even if that's the case, there are a lot of reasons why this man, who has not displayed any suicidal tendencies, should not be given lethal injection. In the case of the alleged Oklahoma City bomber, it's just plain crazy that in 2014, he went from talking about leaving his job to planning the Oklahoma City bombing. The only explanation available to explain why he got to where he is in 2014, is he suffers from a mental illness. Yet Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh wasn't put to death. In 2012, an Oregon jury acquitted a man of the 2010 murders of his former girlfriend and her husband. The man was found guilty of negligent homicide, but not murder. He's currently on Florida's Death Row. In 2010, he got a bad reaction to painkillers, that made him depressed and suicidal. That depression continued for six years. Yet despite the evidence for mental illness, and a history of suicide attempts and self-harm from several different sources, the Oregon jury cleared him of murder and manslaughter, and ordered five years of probation for his crime. In California, the same jury acquitted a man in 2011 when he shot a police officer in the head. He shot his partner after the officer threatened to arrest him for selling marijuana. But the jury found him not guilty of murder in the officer's death. He then murdered himself during his own police interrogation, in which he talked about his mental illness. The Oregon Court of Appeal found the judge in this case abused his discretion when the jury sent McVeigh to death row. They ruled that the judge could have imposed more lenient sentences had he been able to consider the mental illness of McVeigh. Yet, California hasn't followed Oregon by executing such a dangerous killer as McVeigh. In 2003, California authorities sentenced a man with a history of violence to die to death for murdering a neighbor with a butcher knife. While he was condemned to death, his attorneys argued the sentence was too severe. But in January of this year, a judge declared that the death penalty in California is unconstitutional, and overturned the death sentence for this man. California courts will be able to impose the death penalty again for McVeigh, even without the new findings on mental illness. But in the McVeigh case, it wasn't like he got lucky. It was that the jury decided to ignore the evidence. They did so despite knowing the case was full of evidence as to McVeigh's possible mental health problems, and despite the fact that the defendant had been offered treatment for his mental illness. Yet, the jury decided McVeigh was guilty anyway. It shouldn't take years of serious research to recognize mental illness. The idea that a person who is mentally ill doesn't need help and can be left to his own devices is beyond preposterous. People diagnosed with schizophrenia, manic depression, and other mental illness are more likely to commit suicide as a result of their mental illness. But what McVeigh did was worse because he didn't get treatment. He killed himself instead of facing a judge, the jury, and a jury of his fellow fellow Americans who felt he should face justice for his crimes. In Oklahoma, it appeared the jury got the same memo. Not only was McVeigh convicted, and sentenced to death, but he died on January 17 just hours before his execution was scheduled to happen. It remains unclear if this was from natural causes or from execution drugs. Either way, it means death is still in the bag. Yet another Oklahoma court has halted McVeigh's execution, forcing the governor to ask the state Supreme Court to grant an emergency stay to put McVeigh back on Oklahoma death row until after Oklahoma executes another inmate next week. McVeigh's attorneys are trying to argue his client was mentally ill, but the defense team couldn't identify any doctors who'd treated McVeigh for mental illness for over a decade, and even if McVeigh had a diagnosis, it's still possible his mental health would have deteriorated anyway. In the case of Timothy McVeigh, the state may have proven him mentally ill, but it wasn't enough to make him mentally ill enough to face a death sentence. That's another reason why the Oklahoma City bomber should be spared.",1,ai
"This is my first truly viable T10 build, the MD-10 ""Demeter"". Named after the Greek goddess of the harvest, the idea was to make a decently mobile, very tough medic that can help me harvest lots of RP. So far, it has done very well in battle and is usually the last bot alive if the game ends in defeat. I'm not sure how many of each type of armor block I used, but the chassis is mostly inners, prisms, and tetras, except for the bottom layer which is made up of cubes to lower the center of gravity. Incoming damage from the top gets transfered mostly to the sides of the bot, and not to the wheels or pilot seat area. Squeezed into the cockpit are two T10 forward and two T8 reverse thrusters for added mobility. If at the right angle, 6 nanos can focus on one target at once, but the layout of the guns is better suited to healing multiple targets. Last two pictures are of the interior, the latter with thrusters removed. Damage from underneath is routed around the pilot seat with use of prisms, and the build also features anti-gunbrella gun-nests with and 7 guns total for a little redundancy. Overall, a fairly balanced medic build with an empasis on armor that has been very fun to play. It behaves very much like a Paladin would in an RPG game; Healing whilst also being able to put itself between an ally and incoming fire and soak up plasma or rail hits with ease.",0,human

"A woman who was shot and killed by a Houston police officer earlier this month was allegedly ""wanting him to get off of her."" KPRC 2 reported that 19-year-old Crystal Gaines was killed by officer Adam Sowders. Gaines was shot near the apartment complex where she lived. He then turned the gun on Sowders, killing him and wounding another officer inside the apartment complex. SPONSORED Gaines had been in a verbal altercation with a nearby neighbor that was captured on video. That footage also appears to contradict a statement Sowders reportedly gave police officers before his shooting of Gaines. Gaines was reportedly unarmed. Her father said, ""This is a young girl who was scared of the guy, that was following her, her boyfriend. And, she was afraid of him."" Sowders has been placed on modified duty. An attorney representing Gaines' family said, ""They were concerned for her.""

"In September last year, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and local authorities evacuated 11,000 people from high-threat areas of Houston's Galleria area near the Galleria Mall on the southeast corner of Alabama and Westheimer streets. A few months later, the Galleria closed its shopping center but kept in place several of its anchor stores — including Hobby Lobby. Hobby Lobby President Steve Green refused to shut down the stores, saying they were ""a symbol of our commitment to religious liberty, and we will continue to defend that principle."" He said many of the displaced residents were able to return as Hobby Lobby officials worked with some of them and other businesses to plan the relocation to two nearby shopping centers across the street, according to a story in the Houston Chronicle. As the situation continues to play out in the litigation over the Affordable Care Act, where the plaintiffs are fighting for a halt to Obama administration regulations for employer health plans, those questions of the free exercise of religion and the First Amendment in the public square are being renewed. A federal judge in Alabama is considering arguments in a lawsuit filed on behalf of a local activist that would put the town in defiance of a federal law the activist and others say prevents local towns from enacting a gay equivalent to the traditional marriage statute in the state. As it relates to the case against Galleria, the judge has ruled that Hobby Lobby can close its stores in the shopping center without suffering loss of income. The local activist who filed the complaint against the town said Thursday he was disappointed with the ruling in Birmingham, Ala. But the activist said he would press for what he calls the ""equal footing"" provision before the courts — that the town have to allow businesses to choose whether to provide services like health insurance for gay employees who work for them. The activist, Michael Newdow, said he believed it was appropriate to ask the town's residents to pass judgment on the town and the business owners with whom they disagree on the merits of the question of gay civil rights, or the business owners' ability to make that decision and live with the consequences. ""If you give people a chance to talk and debate, maybe they will do so,"" Newdow said. ""And that's what we've found working in other communities."" Newdow's complaint claims that the Town of Birmingham's ordinance, in part, would deny gay residents the ""equal footing"" they sought because the town wouldn't allow the businesses to provide health benefits to employees who are gay if it doesn't want to go along with the federal government. Newdow said he didn't believe the court system could properly resolve the merits of the claim of equal footing or make a ruling whether the city is violating the law — that would be up to a lower court. To put the case where it stands now, Hobby Lobby argued that the federal government should not be able to put its thumb in the market or dictate ""religious freedom"" in a manner that would ""impose an impermissible condition"" on businesses that does not affect others. The law in question, called ""the Johnson Amendment"" and signed by former President Johnson, says religious organizations cannot be forced to participate in or fund political campaigns to influence elections. While the court said there isn't a direct way to determine exactly how that might be applied, Hobby Lobby argued that it would ""undoubtedly lead to a chilling effect on the religious exercise"" of companies who have a particular view on the issue. The issue is one that the plaintiffs in Hobby Lobby have said they have struggled with throughout the process. In a petition to the court earlier this year, the plaintiffs said the government's ability to implement the ""Johnson Amendment"" threatens to chill their rights to free speech and religion. The plaintiffs and the defendants have yet to reach a settlement on which party would be the party that bears the responsibility for enforcing the federal ""Johnson Amendment"" restrictions.",1,ai

"It is not the first time that a US president has tried to use nuclear war with North Korea as a threat to get what he wants; his predecessors had the same idea, only to find it useless in North Korea. There is no better example of this than the current military exercises. They can provoke the North Koreans in a situation that could lead to an armed clash. The threat of such an event raises the stakes and provides an argument for Pyongyang to respond. North Korea, for its part, often uses such a chance to say: what do we have to fear from the United States? A nuclear war makes perfect sense; not only do these exercises threaten the North Korean regime, they would do great damage to the American people. That is why President Trump is getting help from Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is willing to cooperate with the United States, albeit only within the international framework. China has come under increasing pressure from North Korea since the recent missile provocation by Kim Jong Un. Even the United Sates and Japan are becoming more hostile toward China and South Korea. As China is North Korea's biggest trading partner, it is crucial to have a strong relationship with China. Trump and Xi cannot have a normal diplomatic channel that is not threatened by Pyongyang. There is nothing China has done that can guarantee the future or peace in the Korean peninsula. China can have no influence on the country. It will be no different than when Henry Kissinger visited Beijing in the 1970s. His visit was interpreted by Beijing like a threat, an invitation to invade South Korea. We had a civil war in China, and what has been done at the United Nations to make the North Koreans pay? Nothing. We didn't even get a veto on the Security Council, which China used to veto. China only uses sanctions and pressure over North Korea, but nothing else. The US has a much bigger stake in solving the problems in the Korean peninsula than in trying to solve them in China. Trump is right to express his concern over the North Korean test. His proposal to talk to North Korea by cutting off its exports of coal and oil is a step forward. But more diplomatic options must be available when a major power tries its utmost to put pressure on North Korea. This does not mean that negotiations cannot be used to keep North Korea from escalating the crisis and destroying South Korea by launching missiles. No one thinks this will happen, but it will be possible if China continues to oppose North Korea. Trump already sees the failure in the way he handled China. ""You are the greatest and most reliable trading partner."" It might be a long-term friendship in the eyes of Trump, but what will he do when Xi Jinping shows him no political return on his investment? China's influence is more important now than it was a few years ago, and it is also more dangerous now than during the Cold War. That is why the United States must strengthen its influence in terms of economic, political and military resources. It has to develop better relations with India and Pakistan. North Korea is not their principal concern right now; they would prefer to solve their problems through negotiation on their own and don't seek US help. They have to solve their problems using China's assistance. While North Korea is a priority for the US, a lot of other issues need to be discussed, including the US stance on China's One Belt, One Road initiative to bring countries like Southeast Asian countries and Europe to China. There is no other way to make the project a success. No one believes that China will be able to deliver its own infrastructure, and this has led to the project's failure in the past. If the goal of the Chinese initiative is political cooperation in Asia-Pacific, then the U.S must help bring the project to life. China also has a strong interest in resolving the standoff over the South China Sea. Trump has not forgotten that North Korea is a source of tension of the global geopolitical situation. The world, especially the United States, cannot afford the risk of the Korean Peninsula falling into an all-out war. He should start to understand how the situation has become dangerous and try his best to find a solution. If he wants, he still has options and is not a victim of a failure as so many people claim.",1,ai
"""This is what happens when the president sends us to war. What does America stand for?"" he told NBC News. Biden and Kerry spoke to the press a day after a U.S. airstrike in Mosul killed between 30 and 40 people, including dozens of civilians. That attack was the second time in the past week that Iraqi forces supported by American warplanes launched an assault on the city, a predominantly Sunni Arab city of about 1.6 million people. The U.S. is leading Iraq in its war against Islamic State militants, which has included air raids over the past week in Iraq's two largest cities, Mosul and a smaller operation to isolate Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, both of which are near the Syrian border. The U.S. has not said whether it will provide military assistance or airstrikes in Syria, where Islamic State fighters are massing in the border areas. A spokesman for the U.S. Central Command, U.S. Army Col. Steve Warren, said he could not comment on whether any strikes have been planned. There are many questions in the aftermath of the strikes: Who was behind, whether there are still other fighters or weapons in the area and whether any civilian deaths resulted from U.S. forces or the Iraqis. Biden acknowledged that ""a whole bunch of people died,"" before adding, ""This is what happens when the president sends us to war."" He then said he would not characterize the incident in detail. Kerry said the Iraqi military did a very good job of trying to protect the civilians, but when he spoke with Iraqi military leaders on Thursday, there was confusion about whether there were civilians in the area that could have been saved. ""At no point was there any information that indicated that any civilians were in danger,"" Kerry said, adding: ""Any concern or any concern that there is going to be a massacre here, I assure you that we are going to make it known to the Iraqis at the highest level."" Kerry said that he urged Iraq's prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, the U.S. president, Barack Obama, and the Iraqi defense minister to ""continue the effort"" to protect people in Mosul and that he plans to meet Friday with the military chief from the operation, which he described as ""an extraordinarily courageous, tough, well-led operation."" He added that there are still ""some indications that there are people left who are capable of conducting these kinds of attacks."" Biden said the coalition will carry out a thorough assessment of the impact of the strikes. U.S. air operations against the militants in Iraq have been relatively light compared with Russia's bombing campaign in Syria, which has a goal of defeating Islamic State, not the other way around. ""We're going to get out of this as quickly as possible, in the case of Mosul, and as quickly as we possibly can, in the case of Syria,"" Biden said. Read More",1,ai
"PITTSBURGH – The only member of the Pittsburgh Steelers to take the field for the anthem now says he regrets his actions and apologized to his teammates and coach Monday. Alejandro Villanueva, a Steelers lineman and U.S. Army veteran, was pictured standing alone before Sunday's game during the national anthem while the rest of the team refused to take the field in protest. His stand has made his jersey one of the top sellers in the NFL. ""Unfortunately I threw my teammates under the bus, unintentionally,"" Villanueva said in a press conference Monday. ""Every single time I see that picture of me standing by myself I feel embarrassed."" The team had apparently agreed Saturday evening that they would stay in the tunnel, but Villanueva made a last-minute decision before the game to get a look at the flag, telling only the team leaders. However, when the anthem started with him alone, outside the tunnel, he said it would have ""looked extremely bad"" to walk back to his teammates, according to ESPN. He apologized for breaking ranks without giving others the opportunity to join him. ""When everybody sees a picture of me standing by myself, everybody thinks the team and the Steelers are not behind me, and that's absolutely wrong,"" Villanueva said. ""The entire team would have been out there with me, even the ones who wanted to take a knee would have been there with me."" Villanueva said his team would have joined him if they had known about the ""extreme circumstances"" he was going through before the game. Villanueva said he had soldiers and wounded veterans texting him to make sure he would take the field. He said the fact that they were about to play at Soldier Field also influenced him. According to WPXI, quarterback Ben Roethlisberger and defensive lineman Cam Heyward wanted to go with him in solidarity, but were blocked by congestion in the tunnel before the anthem. Villanueva confirmed that report Monday, according to the station. Villanueva, who has been celebrated widely by those who aren't in favor of NFL players kneeling in protest, said he feels bad that his action broke an appearance of unity among the Steelers. ""I've made the Steelers look bad, and that is my fault and my fault only,"" Villanueva said. He also apologized to coach Mike Tomlin and the rest of the team.",0,human
"In some states, women can only get an abortion up to 12 weeks into a pregnancy. If they don't have the money, they are put in a bad situation. Even those in states that make up less than half of the country do face challenges. Here are the stories of two women who made it happen when they weren't alone. Advertisement Advertisement Amber and her boyfriend were already involved in a very difficult fight. The two had lived together for several years, and as she got older, he got in her way, demanding things he didn't want and trying to control the relationship. It was only a few blocks away, to take a taxi or walk home from work, but she was terrified to walk alone at night alone. Every time she walked in the shadows, she thought she was being followed. It was then that she realized she couldn't get an abortion at 24 weeks. As it turns out, the only clinic nearby would only perform terminations when a woman was at 22. Advertisement Amber didn't have much time to make an informed decision. There are no abortion clinics within three hours of her home, and if she wanted to do an abortion at all, it would make it nearly five hours there and back, at the doctor's cost. She had other friends in town whom I called, but they couldn't give her the money she needed for the trip. She called the phone exchange from where she could order some phones and internet for her. There is more than one kind of abortion in the state of Texas. The state's clinic network, which had been one of the best in the country, was completely shut down after the anti-choice legislature passed an omnibus abortion measure last year that barred all abortion providers from offering abortion through any means (that includes the phone). Now she needs the money for a home pregnancy test and medication to get an IUD, a medication that is most often used to end a pregnancy as soon as possible. The clinic that has been offering abortions in her area was forced shut down by new abortion restrictions in 2014 and can no longer offer them. I'd reached Amber on the phone, and told her I'd help her find a doctor willing to perform the kind of abortion she couldn't get, just like any other woman. She was extremely grateful for the gesture. The last time she'd had surgery, the doctor didn't have the time to wait, and his own money didn't cover the fee. Amber couldn't imagine how hard it must be for the woman who works in the clinic to make ends meet. Amber had been trying to avoid talking about this issue too much. It was almost inevitable that she and her boyfriend would break up, and she knew her parents would disapprove. But she was still a little uncertain about her choice, and it was only now that she was facing the decision of whether to leave him and her little girl or risk losing them both. Advertisement It's not easy to be pregnant in a conservative church in Alabama, and Amber knew many other women had lost their kids to such a circumstance. But she knew that she could come out. She had gone through the clinic before, and she had seen the doctors and nurses, seen the procedures and the things they did. She knew what to expect. She didn't think twice before going to the only abortion clinic in two and a half hours. It was easy to get an appointment. One of the women who was going there was an employee at a salon who used her weekend to get all the abortion services she needed. Another woman had seen him once in her life, and asked him to get her an abortion since it wouldn't be safe for her to have the procedure in the hospital (this was in the nineties). It was a quick appointment. They went in together, with the abortion being one of several services of the doctor's choice. After the procedure, his equipment was checked and she was given a checkup, which included a vaginal ultrasound, which showed that there was no heartbeat. He wanted to see her again later in her pregnancy to get an ultrasound. She asked if this was normal, and he said he had done it every time she'd gone ahead and got an ultrasound without the heartbeat. Advertisement A week after coming to his office, Amber found herself pregnant again.

"There are several strategies you can use to plan for less frequent but mid-range expensive purchases while staying within your budget:Set aside a specific amount of money each month: One option is to set aside a specific amount of money each month in a separate account specifically for these types of purchases. This can help you save up for the purchase over time and ensure that you have the funds available when you need them.Create a savings goal: Another option is to set a savings goal for the purchase. Determine how much you need to save, and then create a plan to reach that goal by a certain date. This could involve cutting back on other expenses or finding ways to earn additional income.Use a credit card with a rewards program: If you have a credit card with a rewards program, you may be able to earn points or cash back on your purchases. These rewards can then be used to offset the cost of the purchase or to help pay it off. Just be sure to pay off the balance in full each month to avoid interest charges.Look for deals and discounts: Keep an eye out for sales or discounts on the items you are planning to purchase. You may be able to find a better price or save money by purchasing during a sale or using a coupon or promo code.Consider financing options: If you don't have the funds available to pay for the purchase upfront, you may be able to finance it through a loan or a payment plan. Just be sure to carefully consider the terms and compare offers from multiple lenders to find the best option for you.",1,ai

"A couple who were caught trying to smuggle drugs into Mexico have appeared in court to face possible prosecution. The husband and wife were detained after airport officials found them with more than £4.6 million (£1.5 million) in cash hidden in two suitcases. The drugs were hidden inside a pair of trousers they were found leaving the country from El Paso, Texas. An officer discovered more than £1.3 million in a suitcase and $4.3 million in cash tucked between the legs of a pair of trousers The pair, named only as Victor and Yolanda and both Mexican nationals, had allegedly paid a woman with ties to smuggle them from El Paso to Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, where they intended to sell it. But when the pair arrived at Mexico's Juarez airport in May, they were intercepted by immigration officers after the woman, identified in court as ""Anna"", gave a false name, US Attorney's Office in El Paso told the New York Times. The pair had initially thought the trousers had been stuffed in with some baggage and left there by another passenger but when she came forward with the false identity, police quickly became suspicious. They found more €200,000 (£155,000) in cash in the suitcases and more than £1.3 million in euros and $4.3 million in dollars stashed in their trouser pockets, the New York Times reported. A second person, identified in court proceedings only as ""B"", gave a false name to Mexican authorities, giving them the false idea they had purchased the trousers from someone in San Antonio. He also handed the false name to the pair's sister who, in turn, told authorities they had paid $70,000 (£55,000) to a woman in Mexico. The pair were arrested and detained in Ciudad Juarez in August, court documents reveal. Bail for Victor and Yolanda was set at $7 million (£5.1 million).

"From RationalWiki The theory of evolution by natural selection is a scientific theory which proposes that the genes which increase the likelihood of an organism surviving and reproducing should be more successful than those which decrease success. Natural selection is a term which combines the words ""selection"" and ""selection point."" Origins [ edit ] Darwin [ edit ] Darwin first published On the Origin of Species in 1859, and in it he described his theory of evolution under the name Natural Selection. In 1868 he wrote The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex, in which he used this new name for his theory as well. Although this was the publication which gave it the scientific name ""evolution,"" he preferred to use the more technical term ""natural selection."" The idea of natural selection originated with Lamarck. Lamarck was the French philosopher who worked out the theory of evolution by natural selection during the mid-19th century. Lamarck held that variations in individuals' traits are an accidental by-product of changes in the environment, meaning that natural selection favors any trait which causes a survival advantage. Natural selection can be seen as a mechanism by which organisms adapt themselves to their environment. To illustrate the point, Lamarck held that when a male and female snake mate, the male gives up more offspring than the female, but when the female mates with another snake she is able to pass on the most genes to her offspring, in particular those which make it easier for the female snake to find and fertilize her eggs. Lamarck was an early supporter of Darwin, and was later credited with the first serious attempt to use the term ""theory of evolution"" for a scientific idea. He coined the word ""molecule"" as a synonym for an animal, and proposed that the body of living things are the result of a series of changes by one or more molecules over time. The theory of evolution is a modern term, meaning ""the biological explanation of the appearance of new types of species through the alteration of existing and inherited traits,""[1] coined in the 1940s. Although some scientists call it ""Darwinism,"" these are the most commonly used definitions. Others will describe it as ""adaptationism"" (in the biological sense), ""evolutionism,"" ""adaptation theory,"" or ""evolution-theory"". Evolution by natural selection is also often called ""random mutation"" or ""clonal drift"", with the last two referring to the fact that a tiny number of mutations in each population will result in the survival of the fittest members of the population, while other mutations will result in the extinction of the unfit. This process is referred to as ""mutational drift"" (or sometimes ""clonal drift""), and is a result of the genetic differences between individuals.[2] For example, if two people mate, if they both have 40% of the same gene, then one of the two will tend to have more offspring than the other. The process of mutation and selection will not result in a change in the DNA (DNA being defined as the DNA of living things) so this ""mutational drift"" is a non-event. Evolution occurs because the more variation there is, the more likely a population is to survive, because the more variation there is, the more likely the population will survive, etc. The theory of evolution was also used historically as a means for justifying slavery. The theory was also used to justify the genocide of Indigenous people, as well as to justify slavery. Although modern evolutionary theory rejects the notion of ""racialism"" as it is sometimes used now to justify racialist ideology, the theory of evolution does not necessarily reject the notion of ""racism"", which only requires a belief in genetic determinism, or that certain physical traits are ""racial"" in character. There is no ""scientific"" evidence for racialism, and no ""scientific"" evidence for evolutionary ""racialism"". However, this does not mean that evolutionary race theory is racist in nature; the term ""racialism"" is not used by any scientists to describe evolutionary race theory. There is also the theory of ""adaptational evolution"" [ edit ] On the evolution of language: . this theory is based on an extremely simple mathematical model (no more than a few pages in length) in which a single gene, or set of genes, is responsible for the development or transmission of a specific linguistic trait. The model does not presuppose any pre-existing structures in communication organs or innate learning mechanisms. What it does is set a mathematical standard. While this is a logical and relatively simple explanation, ""natural selection"" is not defined by these mathematical assumptions; the basic model is not used to predict how language or any trait developed from scratch, and is certainly far simpler than a typical evolutionary model.[3] In reality, many factors were involved in the acquisition of a particular language, even at a given point in history; it may",1,ai

The government-led initiative calls for research to be launched next year, as well as a new centre to help train medical professionals in the early detection of rare cancers, including breast and colon cancer and cancers caused by viral infections. The University of Toronto will also launch a new Centre for the Molecular Investigation of Drug Targets for Drug Discovery, with more than $75-million in funding to train and assess scientists to work on drugs to fight rare diseases. Story continues below advertisement ""We just got this huge federal funding award of $200-million to do really innovative research, to help us find cures,"" said Dr. David Stuckler, president of the University of Toronto. ""This really is a once-in-a-century chance to understand how to prevent cancers."" The two new grants will go to six research councils around the country, including the University of Calgary, The University of British Columbia, the University of Manitoba and the University of Saskatchewan. The grants will go toward programs to develop new medical technology and tools to prevent cancers. The government will also help universities develop tools to diagnose some types of cancer and develop effective new treatments. The new centre, called the Molecular Cancer Center, will study the causes of and therapies for rare cancers, such as those caused by viruses and inherited disorders. ""This is a big investment by Canada,"" Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said when the grants were unveiled Monday by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council Chair Allan Gregg. ""We're supporting the scientific research in many different fields that need to be funded."" The grant announcement will also be welcomed by cancer researchers at Toronto General Hospital, including Dr. Harsh Manjrekar, professor of clinical oncology at TGH. ""Cancer is an epidemic,"" he said. ""As an academic with a long record of research on cancer, this is very encouraging."" Story continues below advertisement Story continues below advertisement Dr. Mark Johnson, director and chief scientific officer for the Toronto Lung Institute at U of T, was not surprised to hear about the government grants. ""When a country as rich as Canada has the generosity to assist us in finding innovative solutions to the cancer challenges facing the country, it is a big credit to our government."" Dr. Johnson, who is also a senior fellow at the Cancer Research Institute at Toronto Western Hospital, has helped make research breakthroughs in lung cancer. Earlier this year, his team was part of the research team that identified and found the causes of lung cancer in patients who had genetic mutations linked to susceptibility to the disease. Dr. Stuckler said he and his team are looking to recruit the best scientists in the world to work on developing a new treatment for colon cancer by developing a cancer vaccine. That vaccine was given to 6,500 people in Europe and North America to protect against a rare form of liver cancer that is linked more closely to colon cancer. The drug has been tested in clinical trials in several countries but no trials in Canada. He said his team has the lead in testing the vaccine before it is made available to Canadians.

""You've got to love your job,"" the former official said when asked if she has any qualms about the job. ""You have to make a commitment to this job."" The administration official suggested that Clinton would be looking for opportunities to continue making policy, even as President Trump has a more open view toward diplomacy. ""I think Secretary Clinton is committed to being president of the United States,"" the former official said. ""This country needs her as much as anyone, I think, and I think she wants to make the most of her time here."" The former official expressed doubts about the idea that Clinton would stay put through the end of her tenure, pointing out that Clinton would have the power to choose when to leave if she decided that doing so would be best for the country. Clinton ""wants to make the most of this job and is already having great discussions with her staff,"" the former official said, suggesting the former secretary of state remains in touch with ""a lot of people."" The former official expressed some skepticism about the potential that Trump would be more successful as president than the Obama presidency has been, saying that it is too early to tell. ""We're in uncharted territory,"" the former official said. ""We don't really know what's going to happen in eight years. I don't think anybody does."" The official also noted that while the former president may be a better candidate than Trump because he had a lot of experience in dealing with foreign leaders, Trump still lacks the international experience of Secretary Clinton. Clinton was not the top presidential candidate in the Democratic primary this year. Former Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who was Clinton's rival, won more pledged delegates and campaigned for the nomination. ""You would think that Hillary Clinton wouldn't be in this position,"" the same senior administration official said.

"The new U.S. leader of the Free World was already making a big dent in the debt problem by the last day in office: Obama's first 100 days brought it down to less than $500 billion, about $70 billion less than Republicans had estimated it would be by the end of fiscal 2012. It's been like that through Obama's first 10 months. But as the economy has stabilized, the deficit has crept right back up, by just barely over $100 billion, and now stands at less than $600 billion. The numbers come from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. What's important to keep in mind is that all of the numbers are only estimates for the year that Trump took office. And while Obama, as the president, has set forth a very aggressive fiscal policy (as we've argued before), none of the legislation he passed has yet to pay for itself, unlike the stimulus and a major overhaul of the tax codes. The president signed spending bills into law that have already cost the Treasury billions. Still, the numbers are a big hit to Republicans. In the past 12 months, they've already seen deficits rise more than $200 billion over the Obama term. During the first 100 days of President George W. Bush's presidency, the annual deficit was roughly $400 billion. In Obama's first 10 months, the deficit will now hit well over $100 billion. (And that doesn't even include Obamacare. The administration has said more than 1 million more people have signed up through that law than under the previous plan; it costs billions to run. It's very unlikely to ever pay for itself, or to make the government more efficient. As of June, according to the CBO, Obamacare has cost so much that the law's federal subsidies to offset out-of-pocket costs were just under $1.1 trillion in 2016.) This is partly due to the health care law and partially due to the economic downturn. The economy is doing much better—but that's partly tied to Trump's economic plan, too.

"By: | It's been a while since our last guest with a story, but I hope we'll have an even better one for you in a few weeks! This week's guest is Dr. Jason Norsworthy who is an associate professor at the University of Toronto. A big part of his research is the study of genetics and intelligence. In his lab, scientists have discovered a gene related to attention and memory. Norsworthy's research has also turned up the fact that you can influence intelligence levels by having a certain diet. I first ran into Dr. Norsworthy when I was doing a podcast where I interview geneticists. We had a great conversation about his research and why, given that we understand very little about the human genome, it's good to have at least some of it understood. His research is very interesting and he spoke with Matt about the things he's looking at. Click here to listen to the episode! Here are four things we discussed. Genes, Nutrition and Health Dr. Norsworthy is particularly interested in understanding how genes influence the health of individuals. The first thing he brought up with Matt is how we consume food affects our genes. He brought this up because it seems that even just having a certain diet can affect the health of our own DNA. As he put it: We are not, and our genome is always evolving so it's always changing the way that we behave. If something really changes our genes it doesn't mean that we have to live the way we live until our 70s, but our genes will evolve in one way or another – probably the most radical, but sometimes the most predictable type of evolution, which is a change in our DNA. The genetic modification of our lives can be good or bad but its a change in our DNA and for some reason I think that makes so much sense. Our genes are constantly changing and influencing our lives. He explained that this research has proven that the health benefits of certain foods are mostly in the protein and carbohydrates they contain. Nutrition, in turn, impacts the health of our metabolism and therefore how our bodies function. Nutrient-rich foods such as nuts, seeds and fruits are important for optimal health. Cultivating a Mindful Diet I've mentioned diet before in the podcast, but Matt and I also talked about how your environment influences your genes. There are certain environments that are more conducive to healthy living. Matt mentioned that the best climate to be healthy in is to be born in a place that has a lot of sunlight. The other environment (which he said he had little influence on) was the environment that he grew up in with his family. This place had very clean air and very little dirt, which resulted in a healthier and more nutrient-rich diet for his kids. He also said that the environment in the classroom matters more than the classroom itself and what type of books are available. He also mentioned that children's TV shows and commercials can have harmful effects on one's health if one watches too much of them. Matt has also taken advantage of the free time that he has by working from home. By working outside of the school day (while his kids are at school), he's given himself the time to spend with his family and to do research on the effects of different foods. The more I think about it, there are a lot of things that we can do to be healthy in this increasingly busy world. Just like we don't need to live in a cave to live a healthy life, we don't need to live in a cave to live a healthy life. We can always find time outside of school to get healthy and I hope Matt will be doing that as well.",1,ai

"Kant’s Ethical Theory of Deontology in Nursing Essay Table of Contents 1. Immanuel Kant 2. Kant’s Ethical Theory: Deontology 3. Nursing and Health Care Practices 4. Nursing Code of Ethics 5. References Immanuel Kant Immanuel Kant, in his famous work titled ‘ Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals,’ stated that a human being is a rational being with morals and free will to act in a conscientious manner (Butts & Rich, 2008). Kant stated that ethical conduct is guided by universal moral laws and moral actions should not be a means to achieve individual goals but rather an unconditional personal duty. In his work, Kant identified two foundations of his theory; categorical imperatives, which comprise of universal laws, duties and maxims; and hypothetical imperatives, which are laws that must be observed to achieve particular ends (Butts & Rich, 2008). Thus, for an action to be considered ethical it must adhere to universal rules. Kant’s Ethical Theory: Deontology The ethical theory of deontology was proposed by Immanuel Kant in the late 18 th century. This theory defines a moral action as an action that adheres to certain universal maxims. In other words, ethical action is judged by the motivations of action not the consequences of the action (Butts & Rich, 2008). Therefore, Kant argued, people should behave and act according to some universal maxims or categorical imperative. Kant advanced two approaches of categorical imperative; first, the maxim of an individual’s action should be universal; and second, a person should treat another with dignity, not as means to reach personal objectives. Deontology focuses on the moral worth of action not the outcomes of an action. Nursing and Health Care Practices Kant’s deontological theory has many applications in healthcare settings. Kant’s second imperative (hypothetical imperative) states that individuals should treat others with dignity, not as a means to reach their goals (Beauchamp & Childress, 2009). A modern principle that is similar to this imperative is the principle of autonomy; it refers to the respect to a patient’s right to self-determination during care delivery (Beauchamp & Childress, 2009). Thus, choices regarding issues such as end-of-life experiences should be made by the patient not the healthcare professional. Also, the principle of justice, which accords each person fair and equal treatment (Beauchamp & Childress, 2009) is consistent with Kant’s second imperative. Justice requires that all patients are accorded medical services without favor or bias. Some nursing practices contradict Kant’s theory. For instance, Kant’s first imperative (i.e. categorical imperative) requires truthfulness and commitment in nursing practice. It contradicts the principle of fidelity, which states that a healthcare professional should be loyal and truthful to the patient, as a virtue of care delivery (Pojman, 2010). Based on Kant’s imperative, it would be unethical not to disclose the results of a prognosis or diagnosis to a patient. However, rationally, if this action will cause emotional harm or distress to the patient, lying would be more ethical. Therefore, the principle of fidelity seems to contradict Kant’s categorical imperative. Nursing Code of Ethics The American Nurses Association (ANA) stipulates the code of conduct for all nurses. The Code guides nursing professionals to make ethical decisions when in an ethical dilemma. Section 5.3 of the Code states that nurses should have a “moral point of view” in the course of their duty (ANA, 2006). This statement is consistent with deontological theory, which states that individuals’ actions should be guided by universal maxims or morals. Also, section 2 states that a nurse should show commitment to the patient, as part of ethical practice (ANA, 2006). This guideline is similar to Kant’s categorical imperative, which requires commitment and truthfulness as part of nurses’ professional conduct. References American Nurses Association (ANA) (2006).

"By There are no words for the joy felt when we receive this message! We're so grateful you choose to support the wonderful work of a charity with this simple act of kindness. This morning we were shocked to discover that a charity we've donated to for more than 10 years had the integrity to pull our donation and remove our goodwill from their website. The story begins a couple of years ago, when I received a donation from an acquaintance of mine, and gave a little money to a children's hospice. Later that day, I was contacted by the founder of the hospice with a request for my donation back. I gave it back, but I hadn't realized just exactly what it was that I had given back. They'd taken my name and the contact details so that they could personally reach out with a request for a large donation from all the donors on The List – a list of organizations that have done a wonderful job helping victims of terror. A few days went by, and I received a letter from the hospice, requesting more money from all the people that had recently given to their cause. And this time they'd even included my bank details in the letter. At this, I wrote back and said that I did not want such a donation request to be made of a charity that has done such great work for the victims of terror. What I said was: ""As an organization working with victims of horror, you are doing great work, and I'm sure all the donations you are requesting would be greatly appreciated. Please don't make such a request to me."" This letter was emailed and I received a reply from them (below right). They immediately removed the donations they had received, saying that ""any donation that could be construed as a public declaration of support for The List cannot be made."" Then, they deleted any reference to me, from the list of charitable organizations that they were collecting donations for, on their website, as well as on their Facebook page. What's so bad about having been on the list in the first place? They then proceeded to remove my name from the list which is what the message on their website said I was supporting. As a group of parents, we would like to express our support for The List and its charitable work. You may think that the removal of my name from their list of charities was a huge loss for them, and they're right. That's why they contacted me personally. Our organization, Help for Heroes was founded in 2015 and is based in the West Midlands. We were founded by a couple of ordinary young couples who realised a need – in fact, we are a group of parents who have noticed something is terribly wrong in our children's education and they need to see more of the world. Our aim is so simple- to get our children into the best comprehensive early years school in the UK, so they can learn to thrive in a diverse and global society. Our children are wonderful children, and they have a love of learning and have a passion for reading which is so important when they get older. We know what happens to people when they don't do what's hard, and the world won't be a safe nor comfortable place for our children unless they can read and write. So it was a huge leap for us, as we had always wanted to raise awareness for so many people that read, and they're still out there, so please keep them in your thoughts. We will continue taking a stand for the many people in the UK, and worldwide who read, and are inspired, by the wonderful work on The List. So, thank you for your ongoing support and dedication. We also want to express our sincere thanks for the generosity of people like you who are not part of The List charity, and for all other volunteers, donors and supporters, as well.",1,ai
"This post is the sixth in a series that examines the political implications of the financial crisis and the subsequent Great Recession that accompanied it and that began in 2008. The previous post explored the impact President Clinton had on public opinion of both the Bush and the Obama administrations during the first term of their presidencies. The current post focuses on the public's view of the economic crisis over the last three years. The public's economic views are often affected by their perceptions of what they believe is the economy's direction. In the aftermath of the recession of 2007-09, many people said the economy had been in fairly dire straits in recent years, while others believed the economy had improved in the past quarter-century. Overall views of American economic performance during the past three and a half years continue to be relatively negative. Overall, the public sees U.S. economic performance in the past three years as poor, and more than six-in-ten (62%) say they had a bad or very bad experience at work or in the stock market in the past three years. Majorities in all major political groups express some degree of pessimism about the economy and the direction it's headed. By contrast, the outlook for the future is much more positive for Americans from different walks of life. Even among those with a high degree of education, about two-in-three (69%) say the economy has gotten better, while 17% say it was better just before the recession, and 23% say the economy is about where it was in 2012 -- before the government spent hundreds of billions to stimulate the economy with federal stimulus policies. Meanwhile, about eight-in-ten college graduates (78%) see the economy as better than it was when the recession began to ease in 2009, while just 17% hold that view now. When it comes to where the labor market is heading, Americans' economic views have grown more positive on the economy since March of 2017 -- although not significantly. The public is divided over the future trend on unemployment, with 40% holding that view and an identical amount saying it's not going to get better. About six-in-ten (58%) expect the unemployment rate to end up about where it is now. When it comes to business investment, most Americans say the U.S. is headed in the right direction, although less than half say it is at all or very likely headed that way. Americans are divided over which direction the business cycle is headed. Roughly three-quarters (74%) say we're headed in the right direction on business cycles of 5 to 7 years. Among those who are pessimistic about the direction of the U.S. economy, about one-in-five (19%) say we're heading in the wrong direction on business cycles of less than 5 years; fewer (7%) call the country heading in the right direction on business cycles of 5 to 7 years. There are major partisan differences in views of the economy in the U.S. by political party affiliation. Democrats are much more optimistic than Republicans about the state of the economy. Fully 87% of Democrats say the American economy in the last three years has gotten better; just 32% say the U.S. economy went in the wrong direction. Democrats' views on the economy mirror their views of the country as a whole. Democrats are much more closely linked to the economy when it comes to the direction in which it's headed. Nearly two-thirds of Democrats say the economy has improved over the past three years, while less than half of Republicans and independents say the same. Republicans' views are more negative at this point in time with 42% saying it's gotten worse and 35% saying it's gotten better. By contrast, independents are generally less optimistic about the economy than are Democrats, and the public's pessimistic views of the economy reflect this partisan divide. About eight-in-ten independents say the economy has gotten better over the past three years, while 29% say it's gotten worse. Partisan gaps in public views of the job market are also large: Most Republicans (71%) say the U.S. is doing a lot better right now; just 18% say the country is largely in the right direction. By contrast, most Democrats and independents think the economy is in the same state -- 29% and 29% respectively say the country is mostly doing well. At the same time, Republicans and Democrats say economic hardship is more concentrated among their political opponents. Roughly three-quarters of Republicans (74%) think ""hard-working families struggle to get ahead"" because of policy choices by Democrats, Democrats or both. Just a third of independents say this. About one-in-five independents (19%) say most people can afford some good things in life, which is about the same proportion who say this (18%) in December 2008. This is similar to the views on this topic from 2008.",1,ai

"Ever since Jio burst into the scene with its disruptive pricing and unlimited data offers, all other telecom operators have been desperately slashing prices/introducing new packs left, right and centre. The situation has become exacerbated ever since Jio introduced its Prime service a few weeks ago which offers existing subscribers the opportunity to continue with their daily unlimited data cap. As a result, all major operators have been forced to come up with new and updated plans in a bid to compete with Jio. Also Read: Prepaid or postpaid? After Jio, phone plans are better if you are committed Last week, we saw Airtel, Idea and Vodafone introduce new prepaid plans offering unlimited daily data and voice calls and now it seems Airtel has also updated their 'myPlan Infinity' postpaid plans to offer more data. Earlier, the cheapest 'Infinity' plan was the Rs 549 plan which offered 3GB of 4G data along with 100SMS/day, unlimited local/STD calls to any operator and free incoming roaming calls. Now the Rs 499 plan offers the same with the Rs 549 plan seeing a data bump to 4GB. Airtel has also updated the other plans with more data - The Rs 799 plan now offers 6GB of data, Rs 999 offers 8GB of data, Rs 1199 offers 11GB of data and Rs 1599 offers 16GB of data. At the rate companies these days are introducing new offers, it is very possible that Airtel changes these plans again in a few days Plans north of Rs 799 also offer unlimited roaming calls, both incoming and outgoing. All plans also come with a free subscription to Airtel's music and movie streaming services - Wynk Music and Airtel Movies. Why do we have a question mark in the headline? Because at the rate companies these days are introducing new packs and dropping old ones, it is very possible that Airtel changes these plans again in a few days. No one can be sure as to what plans are available at a given date. Instead of announcing plan changes publicly, companies are discreetly introducing new offers and plans directly to customers. What makes the situation even more confusing is the fact that some of these plans are only offered to selected customers, and not all. Airtel also recently introduced a Rs 345 prepaid plan, which offers 28GB of 4G data (1GB/daily) and unlimited voice/calls with a validity of 28 days. The catch here is that out of the 1GB daily data cap, only 500MB is available during the day and the rest 500MB can only be consumed between 3 and 5 am at night.

"What happened in the last ten years since the creation of the world wide web, when the digital revolution hit? As the web grew in size, with websites such as YouTube and Facebook exploding in popularity, so to did the price of bandwidth. When the web began to bloom in popularity, so did the price of bandwidth. When the web became a viable alternative alternative to television and the telephone, so did the price of bandwidth. At the time, this new, more efficient, cost efficient and scalable digital infrastructure would have been more than sufficient for the growth of the web. However, these new infrastructure required new technologies that would help it run efficiently and ensure that everything ran smoothly. The creation of the Internet was not the end, but rather the beginning of the end of the traditional system. In 1994, the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) was handed the responsibility to ensure that the Internet grew to meet the needs of its citizens. The FCC and the Internet were born from the same idea. It started at the beginning, in the minds of individuals who saw value in a communication ecosystem that could help them stay connected. In the early days, the Internet became the first Internet. The web was built for the needs of the web. Back in 1994, a web was not an on-line system for a private network of computers. The web of 1994 was for the web. In fact, it is not an open system, with users connecting to the web for their own private purposes and to connect to other private networks with whom they might then exchange data. Instead, it is an open network. Anyone that wants to connect to the web can connect to the web. By 1998, it was possible to create a website with a single line of code. Anyone who wanted to use a website had to create and manage their own webpage. This allowed users to find resources for many purposes. The result? ""There are about 600-700 million websites around the world today."" — Richard Bejtlich (founder of Yahoo), speaking at a conference of the IT industry in 2000. The web has expanded to meet all needs of consumers. It has become an information distribution system and a marketplace for products. Through the web, people can find employment, research medical information, learn about travel, and even get paid to share their thoughts with the rest of the world. Even the FCC was looking to connect the masses with broadband, but that is a story for another day. What is important is that the technology and infrastructure that drove the internet was born in the minds of individuals that saw value in a new communication ecosystem. As technology evolved from a simple computer, that operated through the use of the network, to a more advanced system, that uses a more developed communications network, the web changed radically. People and networks and information all moved into a single system. Today, the system looks different, and the technology that drives it can be more efficient. The way the web has evolved is because the internet and its services are better designed, built and managed by private entities that are not beholden to governments, and with more money to invest. The web of today has been the result of the hard work and innovation of private and publicly funded organizations, both for profit and public use, that have combined their resources to grow, connect and share the benefits of the information age. This has resulted in a web that is far more than just a machine for people to connect and share information. Today, more and more people use the web as a tool for business. Companies such as Apple Inc, Facebook and Amazon.com are using the web for a variety of purposes, from marketing to research to entertainment to education to health and many other things. Companies have used the web to make better products with the aid of technology such as digital photography, smartphones, tablets and computers that connect to the web. Companies have used the web to bring in new ideas and technologies that have revolutionized our lives. And, as companies have become more and more reliant on the web as their primary source of revenue, many people have seen the benefits of using the web for business. For example, if someone has an idea, and a company needs funding to bring this idea to reality, they can go ahead and look in to a project like a website. The web is often the only way that a company knows if the product they will be building is truly up to snuff. No other way would allow them to see the real merits of the idea they are trying to bring to the attention of the world. Even governments benefit from knowing if their actions are having a positive or negative effect on the web. The web of today is the result of a variety of factors, ranging from the desire to connect with like minded people, to the desire to connect with people all over the world, and from the desire to bring information to a broader audience.",1,ai
"SOFIA, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Bulgarian prosecutors launched an investigation on Thursday over possible tax fraud and money laundering by a senior politician who ended his political career abruptly last week when he quit party and state posts. The investigation is a new headache for the Socialist-led government, which has faced almost daily street protests over charges of corruption since it took office in May. The politician, Hristo Biserov, resigned last Sunday as deputy leader of the ethnic Turkish MRF party, a junior coalition partner in the government, as well as the deputy speaker of parliament. He cited personal reasons. Biserov did not attend the parliament sitting on Thursday when deputies voted on his resignation and he was not available for comment. Prosecutors said they were investigating him following a report from the state security agency, which showed numerous transfers in euros and U.S. dollars from one European country to another from bank accounts by Biserov and another man. Money was also put into deposits, withdrawn and transferred to offshore companies registered in the Seychelles, the prosecutor's office said in a statement. ""Sofia City Prosecutors have opened a pre-trial investigation against Hristo Biserov for tax fraud and money laundering,"" it said. MRF leader Luytvi Mestan said he was not aware of the security agency's checks into Biserov and but that the investigation could explain his resignation. The Socialist-led cabinet has faced street demonstrations since it came to power in May and political analysts say it is unlikely to carry out its full four-year term. Students have stepped up their protests against what they call the Socialists' ties with murky business groups by occupying universities. A poll by independent Alpha Research showed 60 percent of Bulgarians support their actions. A failure to impose strict rule of law and combat graft has deterred much needed investment in the European Union's poorest country and has kept it out of Europe's passport-free Schengen zone.

But covering them and the walls was a thick coating of dark red. It was splattered on the floors, the ceiling, everywhere. Our eyes opened in shock. ``The fuck is this?'' asked Jacko as he took a few more steps into the room. Cora clutched onto my arm in fear as we followed. Young Regi seemed to have frozen by the doorway. ``I know not of a man who could do something like this,'' I said. It was clear there was no loot to be had here.

"The United States has announced that it will take in Syrian refugees, starting Monday. At least 9,000 people fleeing the war in Syria will come to the U.S. This comes after the Obama administration announced that it would continue its ""pause"" on the refugee program last year and take only ""a few thousand"" more in. On the other hand, the Republican presidential candidates have been extremely critical of President Obama's decision. Donald Trump recently said, ""We have no idea who these people are, where they come from. We have no idea what they're thinking."" Meanwhile, Jeb Bush said Wednesday that Syrian refugees are a danger to Americans, and that they ""are not going to be assimilating."" But it turns out Trump's statement is pretty close to the truth. As Politifact noted, there's a lot of evidence that most Syrian refugees are well-integrated into American society. When the government puts up the first refugee, it does little to verify that person's identity and is reliant on the Syrian government to provide proof of citizenship. This can lead to problems for the refugees, too. In 2014, the New York Times examined the problems of Syrian refugees. According to the Times, some of them had difficulty proving their citizenship to the police or had their Syrian passports confiscated by border guards. But in general, as the Times report notes, the country has had no problems with Syrian immigrants. ""One of the most extensive studies of refugees in the U.S., conducted for the State Department in 2010, noted that most were 'generally well-integrated' and that 'many were able to secure jobs and go to school, becoming productive members of their community.' "" The U.S. also takes in large numbers of refugees (3.7 million annually) because it is so much more expensive. The Syrian crisis also forces other countries, such as Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, to allow in more refugees. But it turns out that this arrangement is actually bad for U.S. security and economic interests. For almost thirty years, U.S. officials have been telling us that refugees are dangerous. According to the State Department, refugees are highly motivated to migrate to the U.S. because they will be able to work ""without posing a security risk."" Even in 2010, when the Times examined refugee flows, the report noted that most refugees ""are determined to reach America to achieve freedom and prosperity."" But a large number of refugees are actually coming to the U.S. to work. According to the Center for Immigration Studies, the annual number of refugees accepted into the U.S. in the 1990s was about 60,000. It has steadily increased since then, though at a much slower pace. In 2011, U.S. refugees accounted for 7.5 percent of new permanent legal immigrants. In 2014, the number was around 18 percent while in 2015 the number stood at 22.9 percent. And the U.S. received a record 65,000 refugee applications last year. Refugees are also much less likely to commit crimes than the general American population. As of 2014, the FBI had a database on criminal refugees that contained the names of some 3 million migrants over the years from over 100 countries. ""The database is an extensive list of information regarding each individual refugee, including a complete biographic and fingerprint picture, age, gender, marital status, race and ethnicity, country of nationality, education, and language skills,"" according to an FBI report. In addition, ""Refugees are interviewed in person, over the phone, via the internet and in other ways to provide information regarding their identity, their past experiences, and anything else relevant."" The average age of refugees is 20.7 years old. Some 6.9 percent of all immigrants in the U.S. in 2013 were refugees, according to U.S. Department of Homeland Security data. According to the Migration Policy Institute, the number of migrants who arrived in 2013 was about 15.5 million, but it is expected that by 2019 it will exceed 25 million.",1,ai
"Gun Control in Society Essay Since times immemorial, people have used weapons for protection, attack, and entertainment. Gradually, the issue of legal ownership of weapons came to the fore, and governments introduced laws restricting or even forbidding possession of weapons by average citizens. At present, there continues a heated debate on the appropriateness of firearms possession by mass population. Despite the multiple arguments for gun control, it appears reasonable to allow more freedom in gun possession to average citizens. One reason for raising the ban on firearms possession is the necessity for change in psychological attitudes to guns. A standard stereotype of weapons in modern society is that of forbidden fruit: every ‘real guy’ dreams of having a gun as a sign of his masculinity and power. But at the same time, perception of guns as connected with illegal criminal world keeps people from purchasing guns. Supposedly, a more relaxed and normative attitude to guns would only worsen the situation as weapons would be in unskillful hands. Admittedly, that might cause a chaotic atmosphere around weapons, but the key to success in this case is educating people about weapons. Making society more aware of weapons capacities would prove much more efficient than putting a veil of secrecy around guns. Another argument for allowing public access to weapons is that once in possession of a gun, individuals would feel more protected against the possible attacks on their life and property. It is often the case that people live in remote areas, or districts with high crime rate, or the police simply fail to arrive in time to protect the citizens from violent assaults. Being in possession of a gun would allow the individual to employ own capacities for self-protection. Arguably, increase in the amount of guns carried by average population would still raise criminal activities. For a moment, it does seem possible: the more guns, the more murders; but upon logical consideration it appears that guns do not shoot by themselves, it is always people who fire those guns. Thus, if criminals are aware that citizens can protect themselves with own guns, they would not dare attack so often. Finally, possession of weapons should be legalized in modern society since thus the desired equality in rights would be ensured. Historically, carrying firearms has been the privilege of the rich and influential, and slaves were not entitled to possess any guns. Nowadays, when humanity is concerned with observing human rights, it becomes a primary task to ensure those rights are honoured with respect to the right to self-protection as well. Surely, guns should be in wise and skillful hands. However, this does not mean average people should be deprived of the right to self-protection. On the contrary, more awareness of weapons should be introduced to ensure a higher self-confidence and security among the citizens. After all, gun control appears powerless for achieving a safe living environment. Making guns legal and lifting the veil of forbidenness over them secures a self-confident society where human rights are honoured at every level.",0,human

"Death From Above 1979 Announce Canadian Tour, Set to Work on New Material Published Sep 18, 2012 Following a successful run of tour dates in 2011, reunited Toronto noise pop duo Death From Above 1979 have announced another batch of Canadian shows.This morning (September 18), the tour announcement came via a blog post , where the band's Sebastien Grainger noted that today roughly marks the 11th anniversary of when bassist Jesse Keeler wrote three songs, recorded them to 8-track and asked his then Femme Fatale pal to start a new band. To celebrate that moment in history, they've now booked another tour.This latest run of dates goes from late October to mid-November and will head out from Ontario towards the Maritimes. The trip kicks off in Hamilton on October 28 and wraps on November 11 in St. John's, and you can catch the entire schedule below.While last year's reunion dates focused on the hits, it appears as if the group have whipped up some new tunes, with some probably getting premiered this fall. Whether or not these songs will make the grade for a new album depends on how they pan out in a live setting.""So here we go. Jesse and I have been writing new songs and the only way we feel like we can make them any good is to go out and play them for people,"" Grainger wrote. ""We're going to throw our little muscle bound babies to the lions and see who survives. We tried just jumping into the studio, but the songs lacked spirit. They lacked life.

"""Sneak-and-peek"": A brief but revealing look (no pun intended) at the world of a professional spy, in the most recent episode (with a bonus interview with the show's creator) of Homeland In their brief but revealing look at the world of a professional spy, in the latest episode of Homeland, two of ""those guys"" are shown being a little too nice to one another: A female CIA agent and a former CIA-trained operative, both of whom are tasked with rooting out the bad guys in Iran. But a look at their inner lives reveals something more disturbing than a pair of spies doing their jobs. While the former is quick to goad the younger guy in the blue coat in an attempt to win his allegiance (""How would you react if somebody gave you a hug?""), the latter seems to genuinely appreciate the way the agency treats its operatives. As he explains to the female agent, ""We're all trained to protect the American public. But it's a balancing act."" The way he describes the work — not just in terms of what his job requires of him, but the way we would expect someone who's supposed to protect a nation to behave — is as close to the ideal as you would ever want to get.

Oracle Printed Card Name: Aradara Express Mana Cost: Converted Mana Cost: 5 Types: Artifact — Vehicle Card Text: Menace Crew 4 (Tap any number of creatures you control with total power 4 or more: This Vehicle becomes an artifact creature until end of turn.) Flavor Text: Er gleitet durch die Stadt, eine erhabene Kombination aus Eleganz und Nutzen. P/T: 8 / 6 Expansion: Kaladesh Rarity: Common Card Number: 195 Artist: Adam Paquette Rulings Each Vehicle is printed with a power and toughness, but it's not a creature. If it becomes a creature (most likely through its crew ability), it will have that power and toughness. If an effect causes a Vehicle to become an artifact creature with a specified power and toughness, that effect overwrites the Vehicle's printed power and toughness. Vehicle is an artifact type, not a creature type. A Vehicle that's crewed won't normally have any creature type. Once a player announces that they are activating a crew ability, no player may take other actions until the ability has been paid for. Notably, players can't try to stop the ability by changing a creature's power or by removing or tapping a creature. Any untapped creature you control can be tapped to pay a crew cost, even one that just came under your control. You may tap more creatures than necessary to activate a crew ability. Creatures that crew a Vehicle aren't attached to it or related in any other way. Effects that affect the Vehicle, such as by destroying it or giving it a +1/+1 counter, don't affect the creatures that crewed it. Once a Vehicle becomes a creature, it behaves exactly like any other artifact creature. It can't attack unless you've controlled it continuously since your turn began, it can block if it's untapped, it can be tapped to pay a Vehicle's crew cost, and so on. You may activate a crew ability of a Vehicle even if it's already an artifact creature. Doing so has no effect on the Vehicle. It doesn't change its power and toughness. For a Vehicle to be able to attack, it must be a creature as the declare attackers step begins, so the latest you can activate its crew ability to attack with it is during the beginning of combat step. For a Vehicle to be able to block, it must be a creature as the declare blockers step begins, so the latest you can activate its crew ability to block with it is during the declare attackers step. In either case, players may take actions after the crew ability resolves but before the Vehicle has been declared as an attacking or blocking creature. When a Vehicle becomes a creature, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. The permanent was already on the battlefield; it only changed its types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger. If a permanent becomes a copy of a Vehicle, the copy won't be a creature, even if the Vehicle it's copying has become an artifact creature.",0,human

It's awesome how it kind of unravels and makes you understand what everyone is really like and who is good and who is bad. It's really a very different show than anything we've done before."" It feels like such an important episode for them, because it really is. They want to find a solution for a guy who literally just killed them and for someone else who has killed everyone. The way that he kills everyone is just a little too much, and they want to know that he won't be able to do that with their friends. Also, the idea that this is going to end any other way but with the same person is really unsettling for him. He goes out that way. ""The first time around, he's getting to know everybody. He was a little bit shy. When he was with Jack, he never had a bad word to say. So it really wasn't until that one time, when he is the enemy, before he goes off the deep end and does bad things."" This is also the first episode where Jack is really the bad guy. He is a serial killer. This is not his first time being bad with a gun, but it feels like his first time being bad with guns. ""Jack is definitely the villain of the first half. He was the villain for a very long time. He's probably been the most despicable, most evil force in the world since we got together in the very first season. It's really interesting seeing him come along. He had a whole backstory, with the police saying that he was very dangerous, and that he was unpredictable. He wasn't in anyone's good books for quite a long time in season one. He was just bad. And we've all grown into his character. If anything, he has to grow out of it. He can't keep going around killing everyone because he is evil. He has to grow up and try and become a useful person that we can trust so that he won't do it again."" There are a lot of questions about how Jack came back to life, and it's scary. We've seen his mother kill before, but did that have anything to do with what he was back there doing? ""When we were doing the flashback with him at the restaurant, the first thing he said was, 'Why did you bring me back?' He basically told us that Jack had saved his life, because he'd gone into the fire. His mother wanted him. His mom knew where he was. She didn't want to let him go. He was like, 'Do you know where I am?' And then he woke up because something in his brain must have been like, 'Oh, it's gone,' because he remembered. It's interesting that he has to learn to be a better man. He has to learn what it means to be a father and a husband. This is what he was trained to be. This is what he was brought up to be. This is what he was programmed to do, and then he was just… he was left again. It makes for great drama, and we like the tension between him and the girls, and trying to figure out how she's going to get them. It's the story of a man."" When you guys are talking about being on a sitcom in Season 1, it feels so different now, because the show is so far apart from that. When you're filming, how does this season feel so different because of the tone? ""It is exactly the same. We have to do a lot of the same things. It's just the tone. It's very different. Like it's interesting, you're not in the room a lot, so you can be in complete control, but the people are on set in this room, and they're not so in control. They're still having to perform this much, which you kind of get to play with. If you're doing a normal show, which is what you're doing, it's like a show where we're just taking each other down so much that you're making yourself laugh for a while. This is really like that. You have to be careful about trying any humor at all, because it might get really funny, and not as good. It's got to be a little more serious, and we're just going to have to just do the same things that we've always done, because that's what makes us laugh. So, it's pretty much the same.""

"Ricky Gervais to star in US comedy about a group of barmy, oversexed English boys at Oxford University, to be written by Jack Whitehall Ricky Gervais to star in American-made British comedy about Oxford University boys Written by Jack Whitehall Gervais has become a big star in his native England for The Office (Channel 4) and Extras (NBC) but the comedian will star in a new show made in America which has been designed to appeal to the British. The British-made film, to be called 'Oxford Boys', is described in the US press as a 'comedic comedy' and Gervais is being touted as one of its stars. The pilot has been filmed at Oxford's renowned Oriel College and is being produced by Jack Whitehall, who runs the comedy channel, U.S. version of his own Fox show, The Office, and whose wife, Mary-Louise Parker, is one of the hosts of the UK version of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. The British comic, who has been at the top comedy show, the U.S. version of The Office, will star in the US drama based on an American book by Jack Whitehall, who wrote the book The Boy Who Would Be King. The TV show will be seen at Fox, which produces the British versions of U.S. comedies The Sarah Silverman Program and Will & Grace. Whitehall said: 'I'm very pleased we've found the right partner to collaborate with on this unique venture. Ricky is a legend in Britain and in America. 'If you have an audience for a British-made comedy at any point in your life, Ricky Gervais is going to be one of the people that you always turn to. 'He is one of the greatest talents, in and out of the UK, who will always have a special place in my heart.' It may sound like a typical American comedy, but Whitehall said 'Oxford Boys' is much more than that. He said it's about the boys at Oxford University who, having no interest in making a lasting impression on the world, choose instead to put on a huge party. Whitehall, whose father is a friend of Jack Whitehall's, was the one to suggest to producer Mark Sleeze, who had made television for 20 years, that they put in an offer for Gervais to do the pilot. Whitehall said: 'It's an unconventional comedy about boys who are oversexed and, well, not necessarily in that order. 'It'll be an hour-long special and it will be scripted by one of the biggest showrunners in all the land in Jack Whitehall. 'Ricky is already a star in England with TV shows. I think this will be very, very good to have in the marketplace.' Whitehall said Gervais's 'unique voice' will be a perfect fit with the story. 'He's going to bring out the best of the original characters - the barmy Englishmen.' Gervais, 37, made his name on the British talk show, Extras, where his comedy partner Steve Coogan, 40, hosts. Their first feature, You're The Worst, was released this week. Their American series, which began filming in the fall, will premiere at the end of the year.",1,ai

"For years now, American politicians have been offering a different kind of response to Islamic terrorism. Instead of going after the root causes of the terrorist attacks by the Islamic State (ISIS) and Al Qaeda (the so-called ""JV team""), or the governments that support them, they have argued that the problem lies with Islamophobia rather than Islam itself. It turns out that politicians are not alone. Many of your neighbors, and maybe even yourself, are being recruited as potential suicide bombers. This is a story that should worry every American. There is nothing more terrifying than knowing that your neighbor is trying to put a bomb in his next apartment through an online application called ""The Application."" As one Muslim woman told me, ""People will know it's because of the way you look."" ""All you have to do,"" says Hassan Abu-Naser, the founder and president of the Saudi-based advocacy group Dar al-Hijrah, ""is say, 'I will live my life for my religion.'"" This strategy is based on a lie. The Islamic State is not responsible for acts of Islamic terrorism that it recruits and funds. ISIS does not fund terrorism. The governments that sponsor the ""JV team"" (Al Qaeda's franchises in Iraq and Syria) do not fund terrorism. The governments that fund and support terrorism are not responsible for terrorism. And while the United States is the first country known to have suffered an attack by a suicide bomber, the Islamic State's approach to Islamic terrorism dates back to the Crusades. In the 12th century, Muslim armies killed large numbers of Christian civilians in the Crusades. The Islamic State and its leaders have not been responsible for acts of Islamic terrorism that they recruit and fund. That brings us back to America. Over the course of the last 20 years, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 have been used by the Bush administration to justify an expansive domestic program of surveillance, detention, interrogation, and assassination. The Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas are two organizations that have been allowed to operate in some part due to this unprecedented expansion of power. According to a recent report by James Bamford of Wired Magazine, more than 100 individuals from this group were identified in the United States between 2008 and 2012, though this is a small fraction of those in the American radicalized population. And even as a small amount of this new population has been captured, interrogated, and killed, its numbers have been continued to grow. So why the double standard when it comes to Islamic terrorism? After all, we're not just talking about suicide bombings in Paris and Beirut. We're talking about the killings of American citizens in Boston and San Bernardino. Why is it OK for people to go on a jihad against Americans in America when they target innocent people overseas but not OK when they target innocent Americans at home? One reason is that people do not realize how much of a difference it makes. Even while we watch television stories about the Islamic State, we can already see it manifesting. Muslim immigrants in Europe are committing acts of terror. The terrorist group ISIS is also expanding its presence in Libya. Why is there so little effort in the U.S., and not only among politicians, to stop this expansion of the Islamic State? For the same reasons that we do not have a conversation about why people are going to the Middle East to kill their own. America is already a big, rich, and popular country. We are strong. We are safe. We have a strong national defense. But our national leaders have not given our people the information and courage to respond to the terrorism that is already here—and is growing, even as many believe it should be contained by all means necessary.",1,ai
"BEST ANSWER: This is one of the most common questions we receive. One of the most common reasons it will work and not be your problem is the speed of the computer. If you are using a computer that can use a full screen application then the problem will not occur and you will be able to use the screen perfectly. If your computer is not running at maximum speed it may be that it is not receiving the screen resolution that is required to properly display the text. If you have this problem then your best bet is to go to your Windows Start Menu and choose Control Panel. If you have both a regular monitor and a HD monitor then you will need to select your monitor from the monitor options. You will probably need to use your computer to do this, the screen resolution should be 640 X 480 or higher. If you still can't change your resolution then you can also go to settings and click on display and change it. You should also do the following: If you get stuck on the menu and can't move on to the next screen, click settings and then set your desktop background (no icon) to a solid light color.

"The Instrumental Theory in Criminal Justice Essay In criminal justice, the instrumental theory is based on the idea that criminal justice and criminology is one of the main tools which help to control the poor. If this is true, socio-technical transformation cannot be conceived in terms of instrumental categories because the very act of using criminal justice reproduces what is supposed to be transformed. Instrumentalist theory shares the common-sense assumption that the subject of action can be defined independently of its means. Following Siegel (2007), “offenses designed to improve the financial or social position of the criminal” (p. 54). In contrast, the instrumental role of the criminal justice system is to control and prevent crimes. In this case, “the state is a tool of capitalists” (p. 58). Siegel underlines that most Americans believe that criminals commit their predatory and violent acts for what they get out of them, the advantages they receive. Often those benefits are obvious, as in the case of most property crimes. A person who breaks into a house and steals a television set does so because he wants either the television or the money that can be obtained from selling it. Even in the case of violent personal crimes, the criminal can gain something, whether it is perverse pleasure from inflicting pain, the satisfaction of having control over another human being, or the resolution of a problem by eliminating a person causing that vexation. Hale et al (2005) share the same opinion stating that “Much of preoccupation reflects a particular, instrumental way of viewing these figures; that is, as an index of a real phenomenon (crime) calling for specific control measures” (p. 52). With practically every crime committed, the offender benefits in some way, typically at the expense of the victim. In its turn, the instrumental task of the criminal justice system is to control the population and prevent crimes. The main difference between Siegel and Hale et al is that Siegel concentrates on the poor and low social classes while Hale et al involves all classes and social strata in its definition. Hale et al underline that factors related to the individual’s socialization and environmental circumstances are also thought to contribute to the decision. But in each case the offender is perceived as having some choice; alternatives may be limited, and in some cases, a decision to commit a crime may be the easier decision to make, but almost never are life’s decisions cast for an individual so that no choice can be exercised. Similar to Siegel and Hale et al , Magnire et al ( 2007) state that the role of criminal justice is merely instrumental based on prevention and control functions. Thus, Maguire et al broaden this definition and apply instrumental theory to juvenile offenders. Similar to other authors, Maguire et al state that “offenses (it is alleged’) are strictly instrumental and offenders have much to lose from prosecution; prison” (488). Such thinking is consistent with criminological theory in general. Criminal justice is an achievement-oriented field that expects its citizens to act purposefully and productively. To do otherwise is considered impulsive, irresponsible, and sometimes evidence that the person is no longer in control. Three books share the same opinion that crime control should be implemented in a manner consistent with beliefs about criminality. People assume that if the costs are sufficient, both in terms of likelihood and severity, then potential offenders will refrain from illegal behavior. This philosophy of crime control incorporates a relatively simple idea of cost-benefit. Offenders are assumed to be attracted to criminality by the benefits they may receive and are deterred from such activity by threats of criminal sanctions which pose potential costs that outweigh any benefits to be derived. If the gains fall short of the potential losses, it is assumed that people will refrain from the activity. Yet if the gains from crime exceed any potential losses, then crime makes sense. Rational choice is thus an important factor in criminality as well as in its control. References Hale, Ch. Hayward, K., Wahidin, A., Wincup, E. (2005). Criminology . Oxford University Press.

If that isn't good, it's a bad deal, but it's much worse than a loan. You can also buy a house with a mortgage, but the mortgage is a promise and not very much like a loan. In addition, a mortgage has some different legal rights and obligations. Most mortgages have a legal obligation to the bank. In addition, most mortgage laws have limits on the length of time that these loans can be for.

"Megaupload was a file hosting service that allowed users to upload and share large files with others. It was very popular, and many people used it to store and share all kinds of files, including music, movies, games, and documents. The reason that Megaupload was so popular was that it offered a way for people to share files easily and quickly, without having to worry about running out of space on their own computers or devices. This can be especially useful for people who have a lot of large files, or who need to share files with other people who are far away. However, Megaupload was shut down by the government in 2012 because it was being used by some people to share copyrighted material illegally.

"(JTA) — A pro-life group published a list of 10 questions that it asks of Orthodox religious leaders. The questions, posted Tuesday to the pro-life group Save Lives, focus specifically on the role of women in the Orthodox and Catholic religions. Among the questions are: ""Where did the idea of a female priesthood come from?"" and, ""What is the role of women in our religion?"" and, ""What do Orthodox Jews and Catholics believe about women in the home?"" One question is titled, ""When a woman's body becomes an object in the eyes of the clergy: Is she an object of lust?"" It asks whether or not the clergymen, and later the laity, may use the ""gifts of women"" to influence or control women in the home. Some questions are based on specific issues, such as the alleged rape of a female student in a school, but many are written as hypothetical, asking whether or not Orthodox women feel free to make decisions about their bodies for themselves, for example, choosing not to get an abortion. In a recent article, ""Is Your Orthodox Jewish or Catholic Priest an Abuser?"" the website Midafternoon reported that Orthodox authorities are trying to create an atmosphere of fear around abortion. Save Lives, on its website, says it seeks ""balance"" in religion, ""an Orthodox Jew who is comfortable and proud of his or her own Jewish faith.""",1,ai

"I have been working on a new project in Visual Basic. While the code is quite similar in spirit to this example (see below) it is in a different order, I have left out a few items. My first code sample is pretty simple. A new method is created for each item and some test for that item. public String GetItems():Void { return ""1. "" + 1, ""2. "" + 2, ""3. "" + 3, ""4. "" + 4, ""5. "" + 5 } 1 2 3 4 5 public String GetItems ( ) : Void { return ""1. "" + 1 , ""2. "" + 2 , ""3. "" + 3 , ""4. "" + 4 , ""5. "" + 5 } It is interesting to see that VB will not let a method return true or false. To illustrate this let's have a look at the example of ""Test 1"". Test1() { Item1=0; Item2=1; Item3=2; } 1 2 3 4 Test1 ( ) { Item1 = 0 ; Item2 = 1 ; Item3 = 2 ; } I will test only Item1 to see if the items that were returned are the correct ones. Test2() { Item4=0; Item5=1; // Item4 = 1, Item5 = 1 Item1=0; // Item2 = 0, Item4 = 1 Item0=1; // Item4 = 0, Item5 = 1 } 1 2 3 4 5 6 Test2 ( ) { Item4 = 0 ; Item5 = 1 ; // Item4 = 1, Item5 = 1 Item1 = 0 ; // Item2 = 0, Item4 = 1 Item0 = 1 ; // Item4 = 0, Item5 = 1 } My program prints Item4 (1), item5 (3) 1 2 Item4 (1), item5 (3) The main reason why I use variables is that I get rid of the need to define an initial state and get rid of initialisation code. So I have used a static variable to mark the start of the state. Now for the test against Item0. Test3() { Item1=1; Item2=2; Item3=3; Item4=4; // Item4 => 1, Item5 => 2, Item1 => 3 Item0=1; // Item2 => 1, item3 => 0, Item4 => 3 Item1=2; // Item2 => 1, item3 => 2, item4 => 4 } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Test3 ( ) { Item1 = 1 ; Item2 = 2 ; Item3 = 3 ; Item4 = 4 ; // Item4 => 1, Item5 => 2, Item1 => 3 Item0 = 1 ; // Item2 => 1, item3 => 0, Item4 => 3 Item1 = 2 ; // Item2 => 1, item3 => 2, item4 => 4 } Here Item1 is incremented by one. In this case it works. But if I create more items and then add Item1 to the collection we get Test3() { Item4=2; // This is not allowed item5=(4); // Item4 => 4 Item0=1; Item2=0; Item3=0; // Item4 = 0, item5 => 1 } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Test3 ( ) { Item4 = 2 ; // This is not allowed item5 = ( 4 ) ; // Item4 => 4 Item0 = 1 ; Item2 = 0 ; Item3 = 0 ; // Item4 = 0, item5 => 1 } Well it is not allowed because it is not possible to set the value of a static variable. Well, let's try it. Test4() { Item1=2; // So, it should work Item2=1; Item3=3; Item4=4; // Now these are not allowed Item1=(4); // Item1 is incorrect, so it should not print 1 Item0=1; // so, it should print 2 } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Test4 ( ) { Item1 = 2 ; // So, it should work Item2 = 1 ; Item3 = 3 ; Item4 = 4 ; // Now these are not allowed Item1 = ( 4 ) ; // Item1 is incorrect, so it should not print 1 Item0 = 1 ; // so, it should print 2 } So, let's look again at ""Test 1"".

""But, first, you have to get a copy of the decision, and it's not out here.""

"Britain was running out of bread in 1800.The Napoleonic blockade was beginning to have an effect and British domestic production had not yet started to increase. Bread filled the bellies of the poor; children had dry bread for breakfast; workers had bread and cheese for their lunch; the workers wife's had bread and lard ; drinkers had a salted herring and a slice of bread in the pub; everybody had bread was the main accompaniment for scraps of bacon. Only on Sunday afternoon did bread not rule the house. Something needed to be done, so in 1801 the government passed the Stale Bread Act. This did not, as the name may suggest, ban the sale of bread that was old and hard. Indeed it was the opposite; it was fresh bread that was banned. Bakers had to keep all loaves for 24 hours before selling them. This logic here was sound, but brutal. Stale bread did fill people up more, and added about 20% to the stomach filling capacity of the loaf. The government believed that up to 50% of all bread sold in the streets of London was hot, and eaten immediately as a snack. This indulgence by the poor could no longer be allowed Bread consumption fell. Stale bread was also less pleasant to eat, so the government was also able to stop poor people being greedy. However, the Act lasted less than a year. Like many governmental panic measures through the ages, it turned out to be impossible to enforce. The government did try; they had draconian punishments for bakers and offered rewards to people offered fresh bread. They would receive half of the 5 shilling fine; the other half would be given to the poor. A second offence would mean that the bailiffs would take all of the baker' property. Many criminals made a living entrapping bakers into breaking the law. News of the arrest of bakers was always popular. People were very suspicious of them throughout the eighteenth century. They were accused of giving short weights (hence the bakers dozen being 13). Local city authorities, not usually ready to interfere in business, were more than happy to raid bakers and check their weights and measures. Some towns like Derby insisted that the bakers put their initials into each loaf so the bakers could be tracked down if necessary. People did not, as a rule bake their own bread, so the bakers had a near monopoly. Most fireplaces in Britain were calamitously inefficient and it made no economic sense to use fuel to bake at home. By 1800 poor people could no longer buy small amounts of flour at a reasonable price, as it was more profitable for millers, who were as unpopular as the bakers, to sell it to middlemen. Bread consumption was reduced by people starving and living off other staples. The potato was unpopular; some people still believed that it was poisonous and many resented the link with the Catholic Irish. It was regarded as watery and tasteless; outside of Lancashire, it was merely boiled to death. The North West had the advantage of a potato industry in from the early eighteenth century, and then later on, am Irish diaspora which knew slight more about the tuber through regular and monotonous contact. By 1812, large numbers of farmers in Scotland were saved from death by the potato, and the working classes of Manchester were living off potatoes, bread, bacon, gruel, tea and beer- a similar diet to the Irish farmer, who had the same but probably a little more milk. Millers and bakers were still the scapegoats after 1815, when the government artificially maintained the price of wheat by banning imports until the price reached a level that could maintain aristocratic rents and profits. Most rural riots in the period 1815-1817 would converge on the millers. Armed with sharpened agricultural implements, they would demand that prices returned to an earlier level. In towns, sellers in the markets would have their food stolen as a protest at the price. The normal cry was ""Bread or Blood"" , often with a loaf on a stick as a symbol of the problem and a way of breaking windows. I have a whole chapter of my book on the diet of the poor.

"The History of Ku Klux Klan: A Terrorist Organization Founded in the Southern States After the American Civil War Essay The Ku Klux Klan is a terrorist organization founded in the southern states after the American civil war of 1861 – 1865. The Klan basically employed force violence, and intimidation to pursue their interests. The Klan was founded to scuttle and destroy the reconstruction Government which, according to the Klan, was hostile and oppressive. Its second agenda was to ensure that blacks remain inert, inferior and without civil rights. Furthermore, blacks were not to have positions of power. This essay focuses on the beliefs and values that caused the group to form, its development in 1920s, the role it played in the 1920s culture, and the effects of the group on modern world. The Ku Klux Klan was formed by a group of young confederate army soldiers who were angered by the ending of the civil war which enabled the blacks to win their freedom from slavery. This victory meant that, whites lost their slaves. The six confederates decided to form this group to occupy themselves and at the same time carry out revenge against blacks for getting their freedom (Quales, 31). In addition, the whites wanted to have a secret group because they were threatened and thought that blacks would gain more power. Moreover, the Klan wanted to counter and destroy the reconstruction government since they considered it oppressive and hostile. 1920s signified rapid development for the Klan in terms of membership and activities spreading to urban cities. This period was characterized by; economic dislocation, political and social unrest that followed the First World War hence the rise of the Klan. In 1921, the group was estimated to have three million members. In 1925, however, the group lost its popularity due to poor leadership, resentment against violence, immorality and lack of issues. Come 1929, the membership dwindled only to thousands. The Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s stood for; Americanism, white supremacy, separation of church from state, protestant fundamentalism, anti- Catholicism and anti- Semitism, restoring their status quo and having a capitalist economy. The Ku Klux Klan though often seen in a bad light played a role in shaping the American culture in the 1920s. First, The Klan did not attain its goals but made significant contributions to the culture at the time. The Klan feared modernity and therefore tried to uphold the American culture. This explains their constant rejection of the Catholics and the Jews. Second, the Klan did not want the Jews and Catholics to be prominent and in the position of power since they held a belief that, science would interfere with the moral authority of the Bible. Third, they feared for change that may be brought to American Woman because they were not sure if the “New Woman” would be willing to be subject to patriarchal authority. Lastly, they had fears of the black man rejecting white supremacy. The entire above mentioned, are composites of culture in a society and hence the Klan’s stand (McClymer). The Ku Klux Klan has brought bout many positive effects to the modern world. To start with, the Klan unconsciously strengthened the civil rights movement. This was achieved through the Klan’s constant attacks on the civil rights workers and even murders. It is apparent that the violence meted on the civil rights workers generated public sympathy and hence the grant of racial justice (Chalmers, 31). The tolerance exhibited by the civil rights workers while fighting against racial segregation and discrimination, gives the oppressed world over the strength to fight for their rights. Furthermore, it is through the Klan that certain legislations in the constitution were upheld, for instance; the anti-mask Act. Last but not least, it is absurd that the negative effects of Ku Klux Klan still exist in the American society in the form of violence. Deducing from its existence patterns, it is obvious that, the Ku Klux Klan is a recurrent problem that can not permanently be done away with. This group will always come in the open whenever there is a conflict within people. Whenever there is hate, it will flourish and take advantage of the opportunity presenting it self. This group may be quiet for many years but it is only waiting for the best time to sprout. Works cited Chalmers, David.

"David Cameron's pledge to cut the benefit cap from £26,000 to £23,000 if the Tories win the next election is one of the least surprising of the Conservative conference. Cabinet ministers such as George Osborne and Iain Duncan Smith have long signalled that they believe the cap, which ranks as one of the coalition's most popular policies, should be significantly reduced. (A YouGov poll published earlier this year found that 79 per cent of people, including 71 per cent of Labour voters, support the cap, with just 12 per cent opposed.) It is undeniably good politics. Most voters regard a cap of £26,000 as unacceptably high and the move draws a sharp new dividing line with Labour. By pledging to use the money saved to fund apprenticeships, Cameron sends out the message that the Tories support work, not welfare. But while politically astute, the policy is profoundly flawed. Rather than tackling the causes of high welfare spending, such as extortionate rents and insecure work, the cap places a crude and arbitrary limit on benefits. It applies regardless of family size, breaking the link between need and support. As a result, most out-of-work families with four children and all those with five or more will be pushed into poverty (defined as having an income below 60 per cent of the median income for families of a similar size). Iain Duncan Smith has claimed that ""[at] £26,000 a year it's very difficult to believe that families will be plunged into poverty"" but his own department's figures show that the poverty threshold for a non-working family with four children, at least two of whom are over 14, is £26,566 - £566 above the cap. The government's Impact Assessment found that 52 per cent of those families affected have four or more children. With the reduction of the cap to £23,000, even more would be left in poverty. In no sense, as Cameron suggested on The Andrew Marr Show this morning, is it ""too loose"". While a childless couple who have never worked are able to claim benefits as before (provided they do not exceed the cap), a large family that falls on hard times suffers a dramatic loss of income. It was this that led the House of Lords to vote in favour of an amendment by Church of England bishops to exclude child benefit from the cap (which would halve the number of families affected) but the defeat was subsequently overturned by the government in the Commons. The policy has been sold as an essential deficit reduction measure. But in practice, the savings are likely to be meagre, or even non-existent. A study of the cap's effects in Haringey, one of the boroughs where it was piloted, found that while the measure was saving the council £60,000 a week after, it was costing nearly as much to manage. The council is currently spending £55,000 a week on Discretionary Housing Payments to help claimants meet their rent and thousands more on additional welfare and employment support. None of this should be surprising. As a leaked letter from Eric Pickles's office to David Cameron warned in 2011, the cap ""does not take account of the additional costs to local authorities (through homelessness and temporary accommodation). In fact we think it is likely that the policy as it stands will generate a net cost. In addition Local Authorities will have to calculate and administer reduced Housing Benefit to keep within the cap and this will mean both demands on resource and difficult handling locally."" At the same time, there is little evidence that the cap is achieving its stated aim of moving claimants into work (principally because few choose to live ""a life on benefits""). Just 74 of the 740 Haringey households affected found work, a number no greater than one would expect without the cap given the regular churn of claimants. In many cases, the lack of affordable childcare continues to represent a barrier to employment. Indeed, by requiring councils to relocate families hundreds of miles away, the cap actually reduces work opportunities by forcing them to live in an area where they have no employment history. The Tories will argue that it is unacceptable for some families to take home more in benefits than others do in wages. But this is an argument for tackling low pay, not for cutting welfare. The claim on which the policy rests - that a non-working family can be better off than a working one - is a myth since it takes no account of the benefits that an in-work family can claim. For instance, a couple with four children earning £26,000 after tax and with rent and council tax liabilities of £400 a week is entitled to around £15,000 a year in housing benefit and council tax support, £3,146 in child benefit and more than £4,000 in tax credits. Were the cap based on the average income (as opposed to average earnings) of a working family, it would be set at a significantly higher level of £31",0,human
"For his first big TV interview, Stephen Hawking, renowned cosmologist, physicist, and director of the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at Cambridge University was asked to ponder on the possibility that the universe is at least 8.8 billion years old. The famed scientist, 65, a professor emeritus of physics in England, answered a question from The Washington Post to this very question with the word ""no,"" and then proceeded to explain the implications of how small time scales in the macro-cosmological scale affect big events in the multiverse, if this were true. ""My advice is if we find any signs that the universe is old, that there are unusual features or patterns in its history that suggest it could be more than just ten thousand years old – even 1000 years old – then we should back up our calculations,"" Hawking said. The Post's question about his age was put to him by David Brooks, a New York Times science writer. Hawking first replied by saying, ""No,"" and then followed that up by saying the same thing again. According to Brooks, ""If Hawking is as sure of his position as he sounded, it will create huge political problems. ""A lot of cosmologists are convinced the world is very young,"" he said. ""Hawking will give the impression his answers would be difficult to accept by other physicists. The fact that he sounds so convinced suggests there are significant numbers of physicists who share his opinion, which will raise hackles."" Hawking was not alone. Science writer Carl Sagan said, ""In any case, the question of the universe's age would be a scientific curiosity, not a political issue,"" and ""It would be very interesting if somebody made compelling progress in this field; it would be very useful if somebody did. No one has ever made such progress. But if the question is even theoretically possible and if the evidence is as strong as most of the people think, then it would be the most important question of all."" In a series of tweets after returning from the Paris climate conference, Bill Nye the Science Guy said, ""The best answer to Bill Nye's question is 'no,' but as I heard Bill say, that's only the last word. The question will never be 'do you think the universe is 11 billion years old?' It's never. The question is, 'How old and how recent does the universe appear to be.'"" He added, ""The answer to Bill's question is the age of the universe. So if you want to see if the universe is 10 thousand years old and the universe is 8.8 billion years old, we need to go back 10 times to make sure of the age."" As far as the universe's age is concerned, the most scientifically plausible answer is probably in agreement with the Big Bang theory, which posits that the universe is about 14 billion years old and began as an explosion in the first fraction of a second of its formation. Other experts have suggested the age could be higher than 17,500,000 years. Theories in support of the ""young age"" claims claim that the universe is expanding, or in some other way expanding ever at an accelerating pace. This ""tidal force"" theory says that the universe is expanding in an expanding universe, meaning its distance from any point in the universe is increasing exponentially. This would be expected in an expanding universe. It is also being suggested the universe expands faster and faster as time progresses. Some say this could be what causes the oddities observed in astronomy. It is being proposed that our modern knowledge of our universe could simply be an extrapolation of our knowledge and that our universe would not be the same if we lived in a more primitive time period or at a different location on Earth than we currently do. However, this theory does not actually explain many of the ""phenomena"" currently observed. When the universe was smaller it was not thought it could have supported life at all. Other theories also suggest the universe was not as young as thought. One study published in Science suggests scientists have ""found"" the oldest ""evidence"" of life yet found in the universe. It says evidence of organic chemicals, amino acids and other complex molecules were found in a primordial star, which had already been cooling for about 3 billion years - that's billions more years than thought. Explore further: Hawking: The Earth is 6 billion years old More information: The oldest-known evidence for life on Earth are organic compounds and elements, according to a study published today in Science.

"PALM BEACH, Fla. -- The first person who caught the end of Tiger Woods' practice round at Pinehurst No. 1 on Tuesday morning was Tom Kolker, Tiger's assistant coach. Kolker was sitting on the front porch, in the shade, when he overheard Woods' coach Dean Blundell complain about poor weather conditions. Blundell was also the one who told Kolker the first tee time in advance of golf's first major. ""I just assumed it was raining,"" said Kolker. ""I've seen the pictures, and I've seen the reports. Tiger has done it all his life, so he's accustomed to wet, rainy days. I was surprised it lasted so long."" Kolker got to Pinehurst No. 1 in time for Tuesday's practice round, but he wasn't allowed to take any pictures of the golfer himself. Players and media weren't allowed on the practice green, which Woods practiced on during his practice round at the Hero World Challenge in December. On the front porch, Kolker said a friend was playing video games, but he kept hearing ""Tiger calls!"" and ""Woods, Tiger, Woods."" When Kolker walked up to Blundell to ask if the media were allowed in, he didn't get any response. So he asked if Tiger himself was there. His voice was hoarse and his voice was shaking, and Blundell shook his head. ""This guy is a wreck. He has had a couple of days to recover,"" Kolker says. Woods took the first tee time at 9:25 a.m., just as the sun was coming up. The temperature on Tuesday was a pleasant 78 degrees, and there was rain in the forecast. That meant Tiger would have to play in a drizzly, rainy environment. That's not surprising. Woods practiced at Pinehurst for a week, and weather was a factor in his performance on the first round. Woods' practice round at Pinehurst on Tuesday. (Photo: Mike Carlson, USA TODAY Sports) He hit six shots on the front nine, and missed the 13th with three shots left. He then hit his second shot on the 14th green, which went in, but then his second shot on the par-5 16th was a short putt, and he missed it by a foot. He missed his first tee shot of the day, a 25-footer from the 15th fairway, and he made a second shot on the 13th fairway just short of the green. ""I'm playing good, I'm feeling good,"" said Woods, who was the fourth overall player in the Hero World Challenge. ""I think my game is coming along. Obviously I didn't do enough today, so I just wanted to get out and see what happened. I really don't want to make any excuses. Maybe I should have practiced more."" Tiger Woods' practice round on Tuesday. (Photo: Mike Carlson, USA TODAY Sports) Woods went from the first tee on the 16th hole to the second tee on the 17th hole within the first five holes on Tuesday. Woods would win by seven shots, four strokes in two days. Woods missed his shot in the second round on the 17th hole, an even-par five-foot birdie putt. If his course didn't feel too dangerous in December, how would Woods describe the Pinehurst No. 1 greens on Tuesday? ""There's something I haven't really felt for a long time,"" said Woods. ""There's something more. I've never really felt it, and I haven't felt it since I've been playing. It's definitely not too wet. They put a lot of turf in there."" Tiger Woods rounds out his day at Pinehurst on Tuesday with a 15-footer to tie for the final hole at 11:22 a.m. (Photo: Mike Carlson, USA TODAY Sports) For Kolker, that description is a little different than what he was expecting. ""I saw Tiger play with a lot of energy out there,"" Kolker said. ""I figured he would play a little slower, he would have to put the pressure on. He played great out there. I thought he did some really strong bogeys, but really, really nice."" Kolker watched Woods' practice round closely for a few more minutes. ""I think he made some great shots,"" Kolker said. ""Every shot was a great shot. He's definitely playing very well."" But not every player. Golf has a long history of players who don't do well on hot-spring courses such as Pinehurst, but a lot have thrived. There were six people in the history of the tournament who had not dropped a stroke at the first three majors of their career when they won their first",1,ai

"Hello, and good day to everyone. I shall commence by addressing a point that I will hopefully only have to make once, though I doubt it. This point concerns my writing skills– my ""voice,"" as it's called in the show biz. On my last post, there were few comments saying my blog is ""senseless drivel, unbearably hard to read, poorly executed and just plain bad writing."" At least a dozen people, maybe more, agreed. Well, have I got big news for you like minded souls! I pinky promise, cherry on top, that both my writing and my ""voice"" isn't going to get much better. A brief history lesson: I barely graduated high school because of my astounding skill at simultaneously flunking classes while excelling in daydreaming. Furthermore, I dropped out of college after four years with a terrible GPA. (Wisdom for high school kids: I strongly suggest trying to get good grades. I know it sucks, but it will make your life a whole lot easier no matter what path you pursue.) Sometimes I am so bad at spelling even Google doesn't know what I am trying to say; I get really frustrated, yelling curse words for relief. I barely know the difference between your and you're and I hate the sight of a comma breaking up my nice long sentences and love run on sentences and have no idea what this double period : is for. Now, don't get me wrong. I do, in all honesty, try very hard to write well, and I will continue working hard to improve. But I don't think it's going to get dramatically better. Sorry. However, there is one wonderful and simple solution to avoid my drivel: don't read my blog! Think of it like burning your hand on the stove: the first time it's the stove's fault and second time it's your fault. I use this simple trick to avoid things that I know will burn my brain– things like Biddles blog, Nancy Grace, Bill O'Reilly, and Rush Limbaugh. It's absolutely wonderful: my brain stays sane and if they ever say anything worth mentioning, Jon Stewart will let me know. Bonus wisdom: this technique can be applied to restaurants, music, movies, and even most real life people. And so the time has come, dear haters, for us to part ways. I wish you all the best in quest for better written blogs. There are probably even some on this very website. To help you all on your merry way, here's a link to the top ten best written blogs according to some guy. If that doesn't quench your desire to escape and you're still stuck hating, I want you to put your mouse on the back button and give it a nice firm click. And if that doesn't work, try pouring your coffee or someone else's coffee on your computer. I will wait. New Book! Phew. I think we are safe now. I can get back to dispatching drivel and you, dear reader can get back to that coffee you have yet to pour on your computer. Save some, though– you might need to use it later. Since those still reading should enjoy the way I write, I have good news: a new book written and illustrated by yours truly! It's called Eric vs Cancer: The Ultimate Challenge. It's a short story about Eric, who challenges the cancer monsters to a game of ultimate with the winner getting to keep Eric's stomach. Everyone should buy this book because it's a good story and because 100 percent of all proceeds go to E.R.I.C., a non-profit organization that is raising awareness about youth cancer through ultimate. You can peruse a preview of the book here, just scroll down to the bottom click on the picture of the book. Thank you! Spirit of the Game Alright, let's talk Spirit of the Game. It's touchy subject for sure, but I think one thing people should keep in mind is that all opinions are valid because no one owns Spirit of the Game (that includes you, USA Ultimate), it can mean whatever you want it to. My definition is simple: don't cheat and respect your opponent. First, a positive. I am quite proud of our Spirit of the Game and the players and teams who embody it. Compared to other sports, we rarely have flopping, low blows, fisticuffs or fake convulsing on the ground like a sniper took out a leg. Now, the negative. Some people think cheating is too harsh a word for what transpires on the field. I don't. Wikipedia's definition for cheating is spot on: ""Getting of reward for ability by dishonest means or finding an easy way out of an unpleasant situation."" I have seen this displayed by many players in ultimate. Losing is very unpleasant, and making a call to try and avoid this is very easy. One",0,human

"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in Moscow on Thursday that the United States' support for Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad had failed and that Moscow and Washington should work together to fight Islamic State.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque Lavrov told Tillerson in a telephone call that Russian President Vladimir Putin also shared this view. But he did not give further specifics, his ministry said. Putin had ""very recently informed the foreign minister of the United States that Russia's position on the question of the defeat of terrorism is similar to the position of the United States and that we share the same view when it comes to fighting terrorism,"" the ministry said. Relations between Russia and the United States deteriorated sharply in the wake of the U.S. missile strikes on a Syrian government air base in retaliation for a nerve agent attack. President Donald Trump later fired back at Assad by accusing the Syrian leader of a ""war crime"". Relations between Moscow and Washington had been strained since 2011, when Russian forces intervened in a war in support of pro-Moscow separatists. Since then, the United States has imposed tough economic sanctions on Moscow for its role in the conflict. Lavrov suggested at the time in April 2014 that Western support for the rebels could turn into support for ""terrorists"". The Kremlin and the United States still disagree over whether Russia supports Assad's crackdown on civil war, which has made more than 250,000 Syrian civilians dead since 2015, killing and wounding hundreds of civilians each day.

"This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: I'm trying to speak to you about the Supreme Court's decision, Citizens United v. FEC, which overturns the ban on corporate political spending. It's about what Citizens United can do, what you're seeing and what the significance of the election for the climate movement and for the corporate-funded movement on this issue. Can you address the significance, what Citizens United can do? JEANNETTE THOMPSON: Well, first, we are thrilled. This ruling is an important victory for the First Amendment. But it's the culmination of a movement that's been building for years. This isn't just a Supreme Court decision. It's a movement that is sweeping across the country. Last year, the Center for Public Integrity released a report with the headline ""How Much Money Do Corporate Donors Exude?"" It showed that in 2012, the largest donors, people, corporations and unions, gave a combined $3.7 billion to campaigns. So, this is a very powerful movement, but we're just beginning to see it, and we're going to have to continue to build on this. The Court's ruling, unfortunately, also sends a message that corporations are allowed to spend an unlimited amount of money going into politics. What that essentially does is it allows political parties to raise unlimited amounts of corporate checks to fund this campaign. That's really a game changer. We've seen this before. It was at the end of the '60s when campaign finance reform, the reform of these huge corporate-sponsored entities, was on the rise, and corporations went all out to prevent the reform. And what it did in that era was to allow these very big funds to go into politics before we had the Citizens United decision, to go right before we were able to reverse any of the damage that's been done. AMY GOODMAN: And what are your thoughts on the implications for the climate movement, because of the court ruling? JEANNETTE THOMPSON: Absolutely. So, we've had—as we've come out of the—for some people, they think of the climate movement as this—just this piece of political activism. But the Supreme Court ruling allows the corporations and the—what's known as dark money groups like American Encore and other dark money groups to spend billions of dollars for no specific purpose to attack the climate movement itself. So, I think it's absolutely fundamental to keep an eye on that. AMY GOODMAN: I spoke to the climate justice organizer and author, Bill McKibben on Democracy Now! in December. Before he was imprisoned in a plane crash in 2009 in Bolivia, Bill McKibben had spent 22 years of his life calling for action to prevent the worst effects of climate change. BILL MCKIBBEN: I think that it would be a real mistake for people to think that, ""Oh, we're going to get through this crisis, or this crisis. And our politicians are going to say, 'Oh, well, this is crazy; we need to give up; we've got to just put it off. That's crazy right now. It's crazy to do. It's crazy to wait for the crisis; it's going to come down on us.' They're going to come down. Our politicians are going to come down. It's just going to come down. It's going to come up. The rest of the world is going to come up. The rest of Earth is going to come up. We are here, just as they are. We are going to have to have the courage and the ability to say this is unacceptable. AMY GOODMAN: That last comment, Bill McKibben, who just flew in a plane, killed by a Bolivian government jet that crash-landed. JEANNETTE THOMPSON: That's what a lot of people are doing right now, and that's why we just have to keep an eye on it, and keep organizing, build power outside of the political system, and make sure that we don't allow it to just be a moment in time. AMY GOODMAN: Jeanette Thompson of 350.org, speaking to us from New York City, where 350.org was the lead organizer behind the ""March for Climate."" The Climate March taking place today that you will be heading to in Washington? JEANNETTE THOMPSON: It actually goes by a different name, but we're here today because all our members are in favor of a climate action plan that includes all the actions that will lead to a shift away from fossil fuels, such as building a really healthy and livable climate, cutting fossil fuel use, investing in infrastructure, building the infrastructure to support local sustainability, and building a movement of people who are actually going to make the transition to a zero-emissions future.

"""If you are a good Muslim and you are concerned about terrorism, then you have to be a Muslim, and do something about the terrorism,"" said Mr. Ahmad, who moved to the United States before 9/11. ""That does not mean you're a bad Muslim. That does not mean that people are not good Muslims in this society."" Indeed, many Muslims like Mr. Ahmad support strong oversight and, as officials say, are critical of terrorists. But most disagree that the West can simply ignore their demands, that America's values will always prevail in the world, that the United States is an exceptional power whose actions are essential to the world's order. ""The United States has a tremendous influence on the world, and we must accept its position vis-a-vis Islam,"" said Abdallah Zekri, a professor at Egypt's Al-Azhar University and an outspoken critic of terrorism. ""This means supporting our friends, not opposing them."" Mr. Zekri has called on the Islamic world to resist attacks on Americans, and he has opposed efforts to impose sharia law in Egypt, where Islamists are in the lead. But he also has questioned Washington's support for democracy and called for a ""moderation"" of Muslim religious values to be adopted across the wider community of believers. That does not mean that the West is immune to the demands of Muslim communities. When the Israeli-Palestinian conflict erupted here in 2006, Mr. Zekri condemned the violence and criticized the ""occupation"" of Israel. He argued that Muslims should support efforts to end the conflict. ""We are committed to peace, but when violence is waged, peace is not achieved,"" he said. The situation is complicated by the fact that Muslims have often been an influential voting bloc for the U.S. government, but have become an increasingly fractured and polarized minority in the U.S. Muslim community. American Muslims were the nation's largest faith group in 2012 with 4.4 million members, just under Catholics, who accounted for 5 million, according to American Religious Identification Survey. Muslims are about 9 percent of the U.S.-born population and, based on the 2010 census, the fastest-growing religious group in America. Pew shows a steady increase over the last decade in the shares of Muslims among Americans of all ages. Mr. Ahmad said that many of those Muslims want the United States to be less hostile toward Muslims than it is, but they are concerned about the government's treatment of Muslims, and the U.S. government's failure to support the cause of Palestinian rights even when it is on the same side of the conflict. ""The reality is that there are a lot of Muslims that feel very uneasy about the politics of the United States; that there is a lack of sympathy toward their culture and religion,"" he said. But, he added, ""I believe that most of the people in those Muslim communities still feel hopeful."" A survey conducted in 2010 by the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life found that about three-quarters of American Muslims say they are either very satisfied or somewhat satisfied with the way the US government is dealing with Islamic beliefs. But that support is eroding. The latest Pew survey shows that only about a quarter of all Muslims say they are very satisfied or somewhat satisfied with the way the U.S. government is dealing with their faith. It also shows that, in all, the public trust in the government is still high among American Muslims, even though trust in Congress and other government officials is lower than the general population. And, most alarmingly, the percentage saying they are very or somewhat concerned about Islamic extremism in the US has jumped to 45 percent, up from 24 percent in 2010.",1,ai

"As expected, the Mom TV show has been renewed for a fifth season on CBS. The Thursday night sitcom will return as part of the 2017-18 broadcast season. On the Mom TV show, Christy (Anna Faris) is a single mom in recovery who's returned to live with her single mother, Bonnie (Allison Janney), who's also in recovery. Christy is tested daily as Bonnie tries to make up for all the ways she's let her daughter down. Christy is further challenged by her relationships with her own kids, Violet (Sadie Calvano) and Roscoe (Blake Garrett Rosenthal), and Roscoe's dad, a former slacker named Baxter (Matt Jones). To help her stay sober, Christy relies on her support system from AA which includes her sponsor Marjorie (Mimi Kennedy), wealthy sponsee Jill (Jaime Pressly), and her emotional friend, Wendy (Beth Hall). Christy tries to remain positive but it always seems like an uphill battle. The fourth season is currently averaging a 1.49 rating in the 18-49 demographic with 7.55 million viewers. Compared to season three, that's down by 14% in the demo and down by 5% in viewership. Compared to other series, that's a reasonable season-to-season decline. Mom is CBS' sixth-highest rated scripted series and will be back for 2017-18. What do you think? Do you like the Mom TV show on CBS?

"A Florida man is accused of putting an electric cattle prod to the head of a cat while trying to kill it, investigators said. The Sarasota County Sheriff's Office received a call of a cat missing from a home in Sarasota, the sheriff's office said in a news release. About 3 a.m. Monday, deputies responded to a report of a cat missing from the residence in the 8800 block of Richey Drive, the release said. When deputies arrived, the cat, named T.R., was located wandering in a wooded area with bloody scratches on its head. The incident was captured on surveillance video, which shows a man holding the animal with the electric cattle prod and walking away slowly, investigators said. The man later returned to the home and asked another man where T.R. was. According to the sheriff's office, the man said he heard someone inside the home screaming for him to help rescue T.R. He told deputies he walked through the house with the electric cattle prod aimed at the cat and then fired it from just below the cat's left eye, hitting the cat in the eye. Authorities said the cat suffered extensive damage to its left eye and is suffering from a number of infections. Authorities asked anyone with information about the incident or any other incidents in which the electric cattle prod was used to contact deputies at 941-829-5000.",1,ai

"As the dust settles from the 2014-15 National Hockey League season, hockey fans are ready to re-enter their fantasy leagues -- and in turn make their NHL draft choices -- less than one and a half months away. But if you're looking for something an NHL GM will be looking for as he scours the draft board, don't expect to find much on draft day. ""The idea of (how to win your team's owner's approval) on draft day is not the same in the world of draft hockey,"" the St. Louis Blues general manager said on NHL Network's ""Fantasy Hockey Marathon."" ""The owners don't really consider that at all."" Instead, what NHL GMs consider is the makeup of a team: ""How are you moving forward on a long-term basis?"" the GM said. ""How do you improve on the previous team?"" And after that, the NHL draft becomes a question of how many draft picks your club has available, as NHL GMs consider the type and potential upside of those players, he said. ""If you think it's going to be a free-agent class, and all these players are going to hit the market and all they're going to do is get a rich contract, you're probably going to regret the draft,"" he said. ""You might be able to get the right player in some areas, but you're probably going to see some players fall to you. ""So I think it's always pretty close until draft day."" To make things even trickier, NHL rookies are subject to an accelerated timetable for their entry into the league. When the NHL draft is Tuesday, June 24, they have 10 days to pass through training camps and show enough to merit their team's approval into the NHL on July 1. ""So as long as we're drafting now, we have 10 days to get our team ready to go into camp on the 25th,"" St. Louis Blues president of hockey operations Doug Armstrong said on ""Fantasy Hockey Marathon."" ""Those 10 days start in a week and a half. We've got a couple practices scheduled before the end of the month, and after that, that's all you have to deal with right there and then."" On top of that, as NHL commissioner Gary Bettman has said, GMs have to work within an expansion draft framework. For instance, if a team has a pick in the top 10, it must allow a certain percentage of its roster to go to that league through the season-opening draft. ""So the players who are drafted in the NHL, and some teams have more than the total that's required, are going to go to their respective leagues,"" Armstrong said. ""Sometimes they're in their respective leagues, and sometimes they're in other leagues where all of those picks count towards the overall limit."" If you are a betting man, you're sure to get a wager on who the final first-round pick will be. If you're on the money, get started on your drafts right away. But if not, maybe it's best to wait until the weekend. ""My feeling is this year, I think we're going to have quite an interesting draft,"" Armstrong added. ""But you probably want to see if there aren't too many surprises down the line.""",1,ai
"A former aide to Gov. John Kasich has resigned amid the ongoing investigation into him, according to a statement from Kasich ally Paul Light. Light, who served as head of the governor's Ohio Workforce Development Agency, sent a letter to the state Democratic Party on Monday announcing that he would resign. In his letter to the state party, Light wrote that he and his wife had decided to ""move on"" from Ohio politics saying: ""I have served in political leadership in two states where both governors were Republican, including in both the State Senate and House of Representatives. I am now stepping back from those political leadership positions in order for me to focus in a meaningful way on my private faith, family, and career."" The investigation into Light, a Republican, and former Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, a Democrat, stems from a federal probe into the state's political lending practices. On Monday, the Ohio Democratic Party said it had received a letter from an investigator for Robert Mueller's special counsel into the Russia election interference investigation, in which Mandel and Light were involved. Mandel has been called before the House Ways and Means Committee on multiple occasions and has been cooperating fully with the investigation and providing documents, according to the letter, though he has not yet testified before Congress. The investigator noted that ""Mr. Mandel has provided us with numerous documents"" that he believes may be relevant to the House Ethics Committee investigation into him and Light. An outside adviser to the Mueller investigation said Monday night Mandel had not yet been interviewed by Mueller investigators as the Senate Judiciary Committee awaits his testimony, according to NBC News. The Ohio Republican Party later released a statement in which it praised Mandel, calling him an ""accurate, transparent and honest advocate for Ohio's taxpayers."" ""The Ohio Republican Party thanks Josh Mandel for his service to Ohio and the state of Ohio over the years,"" the statement said. ""His tireless efforts to make Ohio and America greater should be commended. He has a solid reputation of serving Ohio in the Legislature and he will continue to do that job well.""

"Today is not a good news day for Ethereum. A vulnerability found within a popular wallet has frozen potentially hundreds of millions of dollars of the crypto currency in a second setback in recent months. Parity Technologies, the company behind widely used wallet service Parity, today disclosed an issue that could enable the contents of a wallet to be wiped. The issue affects multi-sig wallets — a technology that uses the consent of multiple parties for additional security on transactions — that were deployed after July 20. In other words, ICOs that were held since then may be impacted. It's a kicker because it is the second time in just a few months that a major Parity bug has been unearthed with potentially costly repercussions for Ethereum, which is the world's second highest-valued crypto currency with a total market cap of over $27 billion. Back in July, a vulnerability in Parity led to 150,000 ETH (then worth around $30 million) being stolen. That bug was fixed July 19 — hence the significance of the July 20 date — but one positive element of that first scare is that many in the Ethereum community, and particularly those who have held ICOs, backed away from the technology in favor of alternatives. Even those who did use Parity may not have opted for the multi-sig wallet. But still it is a major security issue with wider implications. Parity explained that it found the problem when one user's wallet was wiped: Following the fix for the original multi-sig issue that had been exploited on 19th of July (function visibility), a new version of the Parity Wallet library contract was deployed on 20th of July. However that code still contained another issue – it was possible to turn the Parity Wallet library contract into a regular multi-sig wallet and become an owner of it by calling the initWallet function. It would seem that issue was triggered accidentally 6th Nov 2017 02:33:47 PM +UTC and subsequently a user suicided the library-turned-into-wallet, wiping out the library code which in turn rendered all multi-sig contracts unusable since their logic (any state-modifying function) was inside the library. The issue appears to center around the fact that the Parity Wallet operates as a smart contract. Parity likely did not think of their wallet as a classic contract. Their code is in a library, and they delegatecall to execute it directly. — Dan Guido (@dguido) November 7, 2017 There are no immediate reports of lost or stolen coins, but already it is clear that a sizable amount of Ethereum is at risk. Early estimates from UCL cryptocurrency researcher Patrick McCorry suggest that at least 600,000 ETH (worth around $150 million) is frozen. McCorry told TechCrunch said the total is likely to be higher still as more information about Parity usage and wallet volumes comes to light. One high-profile company impacted is Polkadot, a project to link private-public blockchains that raised over $140 million in a token sale and was started by Parity co-founder Gavin Wood. Polkadot confirmed its wallets have been frozen and TechCrunch understands that 60 percent of its ICO raise is potentially affected. Parity continues to look into the problem. The company said on Twitter that it believes that wallets are locked. It added that projections for the amount of ETH impacted were ""speculative"". Update: To the best of our knowledge the funds are frozen & can't be moved anywhere. The total ETH circulating social media is speculative. — Parity Technologies (@ParityTech) November 7, 2017 The price of Ethereum dropped on news of the vulnerability, falling from $305 to $291 to reach its lowest value for two weeks. What happens next on that scale may depend on how severe the vulnerability is, and what total portion of ETH is affected.",0,human

There's some guys right now that I'm rooting for, that I just want to see get a chance to play professionally,"" Dennis said. ""I learned a lot from these guys. I feel I could play for the United States. Not only be able to represent my country but to continue my football career so that I can continue to be around for my kids.""

""I'm trying to catch a little bit of the game. I can go online and follow my favorite team and all the coaches and get behind their team and feel like I'm helping the team out but I'm trying to get the basic parts and the basics that the coach wants us to know.

"What you need to know about the student society fee referendum By Alistair Ogden / Staff Writer File photo by Niusha Derakhshan / The Martlet Every year at UVic, along with countless candidates for student government, the UVSS student elections pose referendum questions to students. Usually, these involve constituency groups looking for a one-time increase in in their semesterly fee levy, but this year, a much more ambitious question is being asked. The referendum asks, ""Are you in favour of adjusting students' society fees annually to match Canada's inflation target, to a maximum 2% per year, beginning in January 2019?"" Dwindling funds pose problems for constituency groups ""We're a bit of an anomaly across student societies,"" said Kevin Tupper, director of finance and operations, in that the society's fees aren't tied to inflation. ""Every year the cost of everything goes up. Usually it's [by] about two per cent,"" he continued. Meanwhile, student fees, which are relied upon not just by the society for its operating costs, but groups like The Martlet, CFUV, advocacy groups, and VIPIRG, remain at the same level, with dwindling returns over time. ""And so it puts [these organizations] in a position where they can no longer have the fees to operate effectively,"" Tupper said. Students currently pay $76.70 per semester in society fees. If passed, the two per cent increase would mean that fee would increase by $1.53 in January 2019, and would then be adjusted every January to match inflation. Across the country, universities have similar fee-increase programs based on inflation. But in B.C., there's no provincial law stipulating such a practice, so it's up to individual universities to determine their policies. Notably, at the University of Northern British Columbia, an inflation-based fee increase policy was approved but never implemented, which played a part in the UNBC undergraduate student society's financial crisis, which was made public in October 2016. In 2009, a similar referendum was held at UVic, asking for membership fees to increase according to the Canadian Consumer Price Index. It failed by a margin of 2090 'No' votes to 810 'Yes' votes. But Tupper is optimistic that this year's referendum could be a different story. ""We haven't heard any opposition at this point, [and] everyone who I've talked to so far has been supportive. I've reached out and encouraged all of the candidates in the slates to get behind this as well,"" he said. But despite the positive reactions, this particular referendum result is by no means done and dusted. Though opposition is not necessarily vocal, it's still substantial. ""In our annual survey we asked students . . . how they felt about this question [and] we did see a fair bit of opposition in that,"" said Tupper. ""And so when it comes to the voting day, we're hoping that students will have read the [UVSS Elections] supplement, and that the slates really champion both of these referendums and push them forward and encourage students to vote in favour."" Candidates' support for referendum uncertain MacKenzie Cumberland, Energize UVic candidate for director of finance and operations, said via Facebook that the slate does not support the referendum ""as it would entail a permanent change in the fees of students. ""We do not believe that the students of today should decide what fees the students of tomorrow have to pay,"" she continued. ""Instead we hope to mitigate the costs of inflation through expanding and diversifying our business in the sub, which will generate more revenue without the extra cost to students."" Connect UVic's website does not make any mention of the referendum, or if the slate supports it. But Zennen Leggett, Connect candidate for director of finance, said the slate is in favour. ""In order to maintain budgets and allow for fiscal planning, we need to make sure that the student fees increase at the same rate as the Canadian dollar depreciates,"" he said via Facebook. ""Of course, we could deal with that further down the line, but student referendums are costly in terms of time and money, so I believe this solution would be the most efficient and cost-effective."" If the motion doesn't pass, the UVSS won't run into any immediate problems, but the number of individual referendums on fee increases in the future will likely increase. And the budget for advocacy groups, clubs, course unions, and every other feature of the UVSS will continue to stagnate. ""What we're seeing through clubs and course unions is a massive decrease in the amount of funding that the clubs and course unions are able to receive,"" said Tupper. ""There [are] more and more of them",0,human

"By John Dodge A few days ago I wrote about the history of the T-62 and its successor, the T-55, from the Soviet perspective. In this article I'll look at the T-72, one of the two main light tanks of the Soviet army. Though they share similar design, the tanks are very different. The Russian military began developing a third generation heavy tank design in the 1960's. The main difference between the older tanks was the increase in armour protection. Design The tank was developed during the period from 1961-73. Its first prototype was completed in December of 1963. The T-72 was designed with dual purpose. It was proposed as a heavy tank that could be deployed on the front lines, but could also replace the older T-54 and T-55 in rear-area support roles. The tank had to have sufficient levels of protection against the types of anti-tank weapons (TOW's, RPG's, etc) used by its adversaries. A new turret was introduced with a large rectangular area of protection protecting the pilot and loader. This was designed to make the tank as hard to hit as possible. A total of six-man turret with a commander's station and three gunner's stations also existed for additional protection purposes. A new thermal camera was added for the driver. There were many other refinements to the turret, including a fully automatic fire control system. The turret weighed 2,900 kg and was based on the T-72B. The weight was maintained so the turret could be driven over bumpy terrain and to ensure it could stand up after hitting a low-flying helicopter or missile. The main gun had a barrel length of 56 calibers. As such it could engage most targets of up to 200 mm in length, and could also engage infantry targets over a short range of around 150 meters. A single 120 mm gun was installed in the turret on each side. The gun could fire APFSDS rounds at speeds of 1,440 m/s (1,100 mph). It was capable of penetrating a total of 7.2 inches of rolled homogeneous armour. There were six gun stabilization systems for aiming the gun simultaneously. Each gun had a firing range of between 9 and 26 kilometers. Each gun was capable of firing two shells per reload. The turret was capable of mounting two T-72S (an upgraded version based on the T-62 design) guns from the top, and three guns and another crew from the bottom. In combat, this meant a total of 24 guns on each turret, or 96 guns total. The tank had a top speed of 70 miles per hour (148 km/h). The gun could penetrate a total of 11.1 inches of rolled homogeneous armour. One of the reasons the T-72 lacked protection against US anti-tank missiles was that they were slow moving compared to the tank, which could then outmaneuver the missile during return fire. It also had limited mobility due to its size and a complex suspension system. It could use a torsion bar road wheel, or the smaller torsion bar suspension systems to drive on soft or soft ground. In addition, the tank's turret was heavily armoured, and had no place for the commander to operate. His job was to guide and coordinate fire. He could also lead the tank by himself. The driver sat between the gunner and commander, whose job was to maintain line of sight and provide protection. The commander also held the gunner's station. The T-72 is powered by the TU-2 series of diesel engine. The engine has two turbochargers, each mounted at the front of the engine compartment, and two superchargers at the back. The engine could produce 2.951 liters of gasoline which could be used for a range of military purposes in addition to power. The engine was cooled by the use of side skirts and a ram air compressor. The tank was also equipped with a dual hydraulic ram air turbine, a steam turbine, the T-62/T-72A engine, which was the first to use all-aluminum, high temperature steel with the added benefit of being low in friction coefficient, and an exhaust system made of the same type of air intake plates as the one used on the T-72. The engines are paired with one-piece cast hydraulic actuators. The T-72 also featured a transmission with six forward gears that allows the tank to accelerate to 32 km/h (20 mph) in 8.6 seconds. The tanks power was increased to 4.8 liters per hour at a power capacity of 3,240 kW. The tank also sports a twin-cylinder turbocharged diesel engine and an automatic automatic transmission. The tank crew consisted of three crew members: the leader (front facing), the driver, and the turret gunner (who sat on the hull roof). The turret gunner was capable of operating two different",1,ai

"Racism and Segregation in American History Essay History is one of the key aspects of human life, and a lot can be learned from past interactions between people. The way they treat each other reflects on everything that surrounds them and causes changes in the world and how future generations turn out. Racism and segregation amongst different people existed for a long time. It is especially noticeable when land is colonized, and the local population is alienated and exterminated. This was the case with Native Americans, which is remembered as a sad chapter in the history books. The settlers that came from Europe and built a new world which was called the United States was an entity separate from the lives and traditions of the Native People who populated North America. In “Oneida Headmen” and “Speech of the Onondaga Council,” it is clearly stated how the treatment of Natives was overshadowed by the Europeans’ superior thinking and belief in their greatness. The whole population of residents of North America was disgracefully and unreasonably disvalued in their traditions and beliefs, and people were forced to move out from the land that belonged to them in the first place. The newly introduced European culture was so dominant and overwhelming that Native Americans fixated on the dependence. Alcohol and goods which were used for trading became their major focus, and so, Natives were overtaken by the treaties and influences of the Old World. One of the Natives remembers that previously, they lived in a land where people were free, who lived as one and did not depend on others. With the arrival of Europeans, they became “slaves” not only physically but morally as well. The new colonists used this dependence and were mistreating Natives without any respect and honor. But at the same time, there were instances when unions were formed between Natives and settlers, as together they could provide mutual protection from a common enemy, while Natives possessed local knowledge of geography. Land treaties that were drafted were a very unfamiliar business to the Natives, and often, misunderstandings came up. Europeans arrived and forced their education onto natives, as well as the Christian religion. This was particularly detrimental because the new education was convincing, while the new religion was supported by real-life examples. This was very confusing to the Natives, and their world was being slowly taken apart and replaced with something foreign and unknown. The segregation that took place happened on several levels. One was moral where people were degraded, and even the name they were called “Indians” was politically incorrect. Natives could not choose their land by law and could not participate in any policymaking. The ability and right to move were taken away as well, and all the available resources were used for the needs of colonizers. A cultural and social division was the major part of discriminatory treatment of the Natives, and their kindness and unfamiliarity with technological advancements were used against them. European treatment of the Native Americans was discriminatory, unfair, and inhumane. It is unfortunate that a rich and ancient culture was changed and somewhat forgotten, as the new beliefs and laws forced them out. The stories of Natives that are remembered and passed down to the future generations are one of the only remaining evidence of the rich and valuable culture.",0,human

"How Budgeting can Improve the Executive Management Essay Disagreements between executives and administrators In politics, there is a lot of tension because of the disagreements between executives and administrators on the implementation of policy. Executives feel they have the right to interfere with the policy implementation because they are above the administrators but the administrators believe that this is their place of specialization and they have the right to do their work without interference and this brings about conflict and tension between them. Democracy is defined by the content of its populist. When a new president is taking over, he takes over the directors and the site of the outgoing legacy and this may bring tension. Sometimes the executives believe that they can’t have a government that is controlled by an imperial congress and an imperial judiciary which is committed primarily to including government in subjects that are not well understood and difficulties that it cannot solve. The executives may flay other government branches in the argument that they are not as accountable to an imperial congress as they are accountable to the electorate and their term is limited. Political difference is a major problem that brings the tension between executives and the administrators because some executives have an element of dictatorship that the administrators don’t agree with. Another tension is brought about by the delegation of duties from the executives to the administrators. The administrators may argue that they have too much workload they have to accomplish and yet the top authorities are delegating more work to them and they have to forward it in time and they end up jeopardizing their duties. The administrators may also feel that some of the executives are not as educated as they are and they have no right to direct them in the way and they end up conflicting. Finally, the executives always feel they are in control and they also feel administrators are obligated to obey them and this brings one of the major tensions between them. Hence it is the duty of both the executives and administrators to work hard in hard in policy implementation for the sake of benefiting the country. Meaning of budgeting to executive management A budget is an estimate of expenditure and income in the future or the plan of money. Budgeting can help in the executive management by helping the executives in controlling and organizing the financial resources and they can also be able to know and set the goals and make early decisions on how money can be distributed to different departments. The main importance of budgeting is to save money for the expenses that the management is aware of and the expenses that the management is not aware of. The management can plan and it can be able to improve the activities coordination within the government. Budgeting is a device for improving executive management because it helps the executives to be aware of what is going on or the amount of money they have and how it should be allocated in different fields. As George Eliot quoted that “knowledge is power” hence once the executives know how much money they have they can be able to control it. Budget can also help the executive management to take control of its finances. It can help the executive management in the organization of receipts, bills, and financial statements that is providing the management with monetary transactions records. It can help the executive management after taking full control in exploiting the available opportunities that it might not have been able to get hold of. It can improve the relationship between different members because they come together to discuss how the finance should be spent. Since financial matters are mainly planned for questions of the creditors, for tax time, or any complaint which may be raised on how and when the money was utilized then with such statements the executives can save time going through very old records. Finally, the executive management can have a chance to be able to save money and cut out all the extra expenditures like buying expensive vehicles for the executives.

"After six games into the new Major League Soccer season, the Vancouver Whitecaps have found that their form is not quite what it appears to be. They are off to a frustrating start to the season that has them stuck in 9th and struggling to gain any consistency, with losses coming against the likes of Colorado and New York in the last three days. With seven points, the Whitecaps sit in 11th place on the Pacific Coast, five points out of the top 8. In that time they have taken five points out of seven games for a +1 goal differential, with five goals scored in the five games that they have been ahead (4-3-3). This is not the Whitecaps we saw in 2013, when they won their first five games and finished 1st in the Western Conference before losing in the playoffs to Seattle (the 2013 Sounders). The 2014 version of the club is not the 2013 version. Their formation is different. Their style of play is not and they are simply not good enough to keep up with a few good teams. Their midfielders' ability to cover for each other defensively, and to push up higher in the attack, in comparison to last season is not the same (Kendall Waston and Carl Robinson's midfield, for instance, is not up there with Seattle). So why are they not scoring goals in their first five games of the season? Well, their attack has been inconsistent, but they have also not been defensively solid. Vancouver has been giving away very easily avoidable goals, like a Clint Irwin header, a Chris Wondolowski free kick, and an errant cross from Nigel Reo-Coker on Saturday. It's too easy to give away goals against Vancouver at home, which is a problem that will likely continue. With a few injuries to key players to date this season (Bolanos, Morales) in the midfield, and with their star players being out for extended periods, they are struggling to maintain possession on the ball against good teams at the moment. The team's inability to do this will only lead to more frustration and a downward spiral that will not be easily managed in the long run. If the Whitecaps have not learned their lesson yet, they need to find something to improve on. So, what can they do to avoid being frustrated in the future? In the midfield, they need to find the best combination they can for each position, and continue to improve. Right now, the Whitecaps midfield is still far from what it needs to be. The Whitecaps also need to find an immediate improvement in their defensive record. Right now, they can only be counted on to concede goals in transition and when they turn it over. They are second worst in the league in the percentage of goals conceded by turning over the ball, and this is a problem that requires attention and a lot of work if the Whitecaps want to avoid the slide that came before last season. What do you think of the early season struggles of the Whitecaps? Think that they will be able to right the ship? Do you think that they can improve their form? Does the roster look too weak to be a contender in the near term with a team that will need a little bit of time to adjust?",1,ai

"By now, I think everyone knows that New York City public schools have had very large class sizes for years now. While the City has taken some steps to reduce class sizes in its public schools in recent years, including some new school closings and a new program that allows high-needs children to enroll when classes are full, our education system still has an enormous class size problem. While this problem isn't unique to New York City, it's a huge one. According to a 2010 report by the National Center on Education and the Economy, there are currently 2.2 million students in schools that are underfunded by 20 percent or more of their median per-pupil funding. In other words, they are not funded well enough. The problem is much worse in urban schools in general. There were nearly 14 million urban students in the nation's 4.2 million public schools in 2009–10, and in a few cities, the class sizes are so large that the class size is actually bigger than the number of students in the schools. A 2013 report found that only 23.9 percent of the students in New York City's schools qualify for free or reduced-price lunch. There are more than twice as many low-income students in New York City public schools than there are Pell recipients in the state of New York. In New York City and almost every other urban school, there aren't enough teachers or resources to meet the needs of every student. There is something wrong with how our public education system was built in the first place: the idea that we should have to pay each and every child the amount needed to be in a classroom to learn. The city now has a new public school teacher recruitment rule that says the district can only hire teachers after they've been ""reviewed and approved"" using new criteria that looks closely at factors like race and gender. While the new teacher-recruitment rule is certainly a step in the right direction, it's not enough. A more expansive reform would allow for more funding to be used to increase class size. A lot of cities in New York and around the U.S. have tried to use class-size reduction as an educational tool since the 1990s–even after decades of declining class sizes. A recent study from the Center for Research on Equity In Education found that in both New York City and Washington, D.C.–where class-size reduction is on the ballot this November–there has been a steady increase in class sizes, largely driven by the district of Boston, which has had ""the largest increase in class sizes of any metropolitan district in the nation."" New York City should be the leader in this effort. As a city of immigrant parents who all went to public school for the same kinds of reasons, we need schools that are well-equipped to give our children the opportunities that make sense for their needs. And the current state of our schools is such that children from low-income families and English-language learners are among the first to have difficulty accessing high quality, meaningful education. When I moved to New York City in 2005, public education was just coming out of one of its biggest financial crises: the closure of dozens of schools the year before, combined with the loss of federal funding, forced the City to cut classes and turn away thousands of children. (See: The school of my youth, The New York Times) In the end, nearly 9,600 of the students who attended my school found alternative schools and were placed in new schools by the city, though those other schools were often not the better choice for us families. In the wake of the crisis, the City changed its teacher-recruitment rules to focus more on students' abilities and ""other factors"" that could predict whether they could make it through high school. It also gave a waiver to those schools that had been oversubscribed. A few years later, the city passed the ""Schools that Work for All"" bill, which made it easier to turn away students, giving schools a longer two-year waiver period before they lost funding. (See: The schools that worked for all: a survey of the top programs) Now, the city can't offer any sort of waiver. It's no exaggeration to say that the current state of affairs in New York City schools doesn't just affect low-income and English-language learners; it's also leading to massive class sizes in schools of all sorts and leaving children with fewer resources. Because New York City is a large, urban school with a lot of students, the class size problem is a particularly important issue. But what about other school districts? A few years ago, Washington, D.C., also cut class size in its schools after a financial crisis, and I recently visited the city to see whether it followed a similar model. According to the Washington Post, students in D.C. public schools are now required to take a course in math when they're younger and a course in English when they're younger than",1,ai

"By Matt Dolloff, CBS Boston BOSTON (CBS) — Former NFL quarterback Tom Brady isn't taking the news that the NFL has indefinitely suspended one of it's most popular players lightly. Brady, who led the Patriots to five NFL championships under head coach Bill Belichick, believes that the league overreacted with a one-game suspension for former Baltimore linebacker Ray Rice following an incident in an Atlantic City elevator on Jan. 26. ""I saw this [incident] and just like every other man it breaks my heart for the guy — or woman — it's not an easy situation,"" Brady said on WBZ-TV's Marc Berman Show. ""I hope they give him the time to sit on the sidelines with his head in his hands like all of us."" Rice was involved in a one-on-one altercation with his then-fiancee, now wife Janay Palmer. He was subsequently indicted on a fourth-degree aggravated assault charge. On Monday, the NFL announced that they have indefinitely suspended Rice after they received a video from an Atlantic City hotel surveillance camera of Rice dragging Palmer, whom he later called a ""b*tch,"" to the floor. He was also charged with simple assault for striking Palmer's now-infant son when he was four months old. ""The Ray Rice video is the most disturbing thing I've ever seen. I have no comment about that other than it is disgusting as we see it,"" Brady said. ""They've got a lot of hard decisions to make right now. They can make a strong statement on the video…I hope they do all they can."" The Ravens were eliminated from the playoffs on Sunday afternoon after a 28-21 loss to Cincinnati. Palmer was suspended for her role in the incident, though she did not play in the game.

"If you're a parent with a pre-teen in your care, do you know what that pre-teen is doing? I don't think I do. And my parents may not have as much visibility as they did when the internet was just an infant and my parents were still in the house. You don't have to have children and your parents to know what kind of behaviors are acceptable and when you need to intervene or change. I think every parent knows the type: those who are on top of every thing with no patience for the chaos and the disorganized. You know exactly what your child is up to at any given moment—from your bed to the dinner table, and you know exactly what to do about it. I know for sure that I did—because that's part of the reason I didn't have children. I want to protect my parenting, not my little person. It is not an unfamiliar feeling; my younger brother's preschool teacher was in this category. I'm talking about a type of parent who is always aware of everything that your child is doing and always thinking and planning ahead. If this person feels she or he has the right to intervene before your child develops a problem, it is no surprise that so many parents end up with a ""perfect little angel"" in their care. No—the angel is only a reflection of the parent. A true parent will never be completely perfect, but their actions and decisions will go far to enhance your child's mental health and well-being. The Parent-Child Relationship In our first lesson on Parent-Child Relationships, we discussed what parents do and how we do it. We looked at the different roles your child has and how much you and your child share in decision-making. We discussed the various relationships each child has with his parents—from the very intimate relationship with his or her mother-father to the more distant relationship with other family members. We all know the types: the child who loves her and only her mother, the child who loves his father only and sees his father only when he is at home, the child who loves his mother but does not speak for her, and the child who is almost totally dependent on his father. We talked about how these relationships change as we grow up. In kindergarten, the relationship between the child and parents changes to become a full-blown partnership. It changes to a more intimate partnership for girls growing up. It changes to a more distant partnership for boys and men, when they are older. It changes due to changes in the child's home life, changing career, changing personal concerns, and many other reasons. As we've talked about parents' choices and their influence, one choice is always at the core of it: does your child have a relationship with you? A common misconception is that a parent is always in control, when in fact, the reality that most parents know is far different. If your child's relationship with you is your life, your job, and your livelihood, you have the power to influence—and if you don't exercise that power, your child will. Every parent knows it takes a lot of work to get from point A to point B. It's no accident that the best grades and the highest test scores in school are achieved by children who are close to their parents when they are younger and to their parents when they mature. This same concept applies to relationships with your child. There are two ways to achieve this—one through education and one through behavior: The Education Approach This approach doesn't involve ""nannies,"" teachers, therapists, etc. It is about the relationship between a parent and child, and it starts with you being a child and your parent being a partner. I think many parents will have this experience, especially if they have an older child or a teenager who is rebellious and out-going. The best parent is the one who is present when her child's needs are being met. She isn't expecting a miracle, but she is expecting a balanced, responsible partnership with her child. When her child reaches this point, the parent, not the child, has the power to determine her child's outcome or direction. If she isn't willing to participate, or if she tries to control her child rather than being a partner, you need to step in. If a parent refuses to let you see when your child is stressed, hungry, or in trouble, your responsibility is to intervene. You need to tell your relationship counselor about your concerns, then contact your child's school about your concerns. Your school should take steps to resolve the situation before you do anything. You need to know that any intervention you make is going to be a last resort. It might seem wrong to leave a child in pain for any long period of time with no one wanting to touch him, but you need to find his strength and your strength so he can find his strength so you can step in. If your child is unhappy with your intervention, he",1,ai
"Sure, I can try to explain it to you like you're five. Hacking is when someone uses their computer skills to try to get into someone else's computer or network without permission. It can be done for many different reasons, like to steal information, to cause problems, or just to see if they can do it. To start learning about hacking, some people might take online classes or go to school to learn about computers and how they work. Then, they might practice trying to find ways to get into computer systems on their own, or with other people who are also interested in learning about hacking. It's important to remember that hacking is illegal in many places and can get you into a lot of trouble. So it's always best to only use your skills for good and to get permission before trying to access someone else's computer or network.",1,ai
"What do these terms mean? Most people learn the term ""micro"" first, as it makes reference to the way computers are built. However, micro can be defined in more than just the computer context. To give you a more complete feel, here are some popular definitions: 1 Small as 1mm2 or 1×1mm1. If someone says ""micro"" but they are referring to an adult size, that person is using a definition that focuses on the size of the object. For example, you may refer to a piece of paper as ""tiny"" but that refers to the size of a single page in a book that you read. 2 A smaller or smaller version of another unit. For example, a small car that has a small engine. A more general definition would be a smaller or smaller size. If someone was looking at you and asking what you were looking at, they may be asking you what car you were in. That is a reference to a bigger car or truck. 3 At 1 micron or 1/1,000,000 of a millimetre. You have a few centimetres between you and a diamond, but it is 100,000 times smaller. The phrase microsecond is not synonymous with millisecond as is often thought. It is simply meant to be close enough to one another that you can find it when you are looking for it. 4 Similar to one thousandth but one-millionth the size of a standard metre. This is a lot smaller than the microns you can pick up with your fingernail. 5 At one millionth the size of an inch. This is a very small fraction or fraction of a millionth of a metre. We measure the distance between two points by saying inches divided by feet. This measurement could be a millionth, one per cent, or one thousandth of a cm, whatever is needed to place it properly into the context of an article. 6 At one millionth the size of a millionth of anything. This is still very small! The term millimeter is commonly used instead because it's easier and easier to memorise the number of a particular measurement than the actual number. 7 At one millionth the size of a millionth of a millimeter. This is a tiny fraction of the distance between two points, it's much smaller than an inch, and its easier to recognise. 8 The size of a part of the human body at a particular point. For example, this could be the width of a human hair at scalp level. 9 The smallest unit of length. For example this refers to a millimetre or a centimetre. 10 This describes the distance between two atoms in molecules. It's a way of describing distances with a unit of measurement. They are often thought of as tiny, but if you were to measure a single proton with your yard stick, you would be measuring a tiny fraction of a millimetre. 11 In physics, this refers to the smallest particle or atom in a chemical reaction. In chemistry, it refers to electrons, protons, neutrons, neutrinos, baryons, or quarks. 12 An electron orbit is roughly around the speed of light. In other words, we move at the rate of light. 13 A particle is a unit of energy. That means that it can have an electric charge or an electromagnetic force acting upon it. 14 A wave is a group of discrete waves that travel on one direction. These waves can be thought of as separate parts of the same wave traveling at different speeds. 15 One millionth of an oxygen molecule is what makes a human breath oxygenated. There are four molecules in every breath, called O 2 , 3 O 2 , 2 O 2 , and 1 O 2 . 16 You are approximately 5 seconds younger each day. So your birthday is the second Saturday of August, 2033. 17 This is the width measurement of a human hair. 18 On average, there are roughly 100,000 molecules in every living cell in a human body. 19 This is a unit of mass. It is usually a measure of weight in grams, but can be expressed in any unit common to the science of weight or volume. Often, the term ""mass"" is used as a shorthand for ""quantity of something"" 20 At 2 grams (a tablespoon worth) per cubic centimetre (cubic centimetre is a measure of volume), that is about the average amount of fuel in a litre of petrol. 21 A milligram is an abbreviation of a gram. If we want to say that the average human is the equivalent of a 1000 milligram capsule, that means that the human is the equivalent of a capsule of 1000 milligrams containing the equivalent of a dose of 500 micrograms of radiation. The actual units are much higher",1,ai
"Senator and Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders (D-VT) has been one of the leading voices in Congress when it comes to ending oil exploration and subsidies for oil companies in the United States. He has also been loudly sounding the alarm bells, warning that fossil fuels are leading to catastrophic global warming, for years. But it turns out that the senator's anti-oil stance does not apply when it comes to taking money from the owners of oil companies themselves. According to OpenSecrets.org, Sanders political action committee, ""Progressive Voters of America"" took a $1,000 donation from members of the Krumme Oil Company, during the 2013-2014 election cycle. Krumme, based in Bristow, Oklahoma, is a smaller oil company that rakes in $20 to $50 million a year. Sanders himself, also took a $2,400 donation from the oil company in the 2011-2012 cycle when Sanders was running for re-election to the Senate. George Krumme, the CEO of the company until his death in 2013 was active in Democratic politics for a half century and served as a National Committeeman from 1976–1996.

Sanders was a vocal opponent of the Keystone XL pipeline and while the Senator has railed against ""Big Oil"" he seems to have little problem taking money from small oil companies such as Krumme. In 2008, one person died and three were injured after an oil well that was leased to Krumme Oil, exploded, resulting in oil covering the entire vicinity surrounding the well. Sanders has repeatedly pressed for the need to ""transform our energy system away from fossil fuel.""

"""The government should not consider that the threat of an imminent threat from al-Qaida in Yemen is a sufficient justification for killing US citizens."" Two of the US people killed in Yemen on Tuesday, including 16-year-old Abdulrahman Alharbi and 14-year-old Abdullahi Yusuf, were al-Qaida affiliates. As a result of this assassination campaign, al-Qaida reportedly wants to kill any Americans who are considered a threat, regardless of how minor the threat might appear. ""The government should not consider that the threat of an imminent threat from al-Qaida in Yemen is a sufficient justification for killing American citizens,"" said Chris Anders, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union's speech research center. ""A US citizen should not be deemed a threat merely because he is in another country on a humanitarian visit."" ""Such logic would justify assassinating anyone involved in the Occupy Wall Street protests, or anyone who is deemed to be critical of US foreign policy,"" added Anders. Yemeni authorities have arrested al-Harbi's father Abdullahi and three of his brothers for suspected ties to a terrorist attack in the past. According to a report from The Guardian, Yemeni intelligence agents arrested Abdullahi Alhari in April 2011 for ""conspiring with al-Qaida to attack Western targets in Saudi Arabia and Yemen."" Abdullahi Alharbi was also reportedly one of four men targeted in US drone strikes in the country between 2006 and 2008, and as of 2009, he was the target of seven CIA drone strikes.

"Klara Palmberg: Experiences of Implementing Process Management Case Study A new phenomenon of process management is starting to gain popularity in the world, as it increases the efficiency of the organizations (Brocke, Mathiassen and Rosemann 189). In this case, various tools exist to enhance various spheres of the firm’s functioning (Garcia, Vizcaino and Ebert 15). Nonetheless, it is apparent that many companies and specialists assess the necessity to change their regular company structure to process management (Hull, Mendling and Tai 517). A primary goal of this essay is to provide how the process management discussed in the article Experiences of Implementing Process Management: A Multiple Case Study by Palmberg can be applied in a real business case. In turn, the implementation of these management techniques is assessed with the help of the real business case, One Stop Logistics. The company was chosen, as a potential candidate for evaluation since it has some similarities with the Company A, which was presented in the article. Firstly, the main points of the article used for the analysis have to be summarized. It is apparent that the author focuses on the implementation process of project management practices with the examples of various cases (Palmberg 93). It paid attention to three different organizations, which have different background and structure to discover the effects of the implementation of the process management model. It is apparent that Company A, which was “a logistic company owned by the organization whose products they are transported”, had the most positive results (Palmberg 100). Consequently, an enterprise with a similar structure is chosen as a real case example; as it is clear that this type of business will benefit the most from the implementation process. It is apparent that a sophisticated corporation will experience fewer difficulties while implementing process management. In this case, One Stop Logistics can be used as an example, as it was just acquired by Echo Global Logistics, Inc. (Bowman par. 2). It is apparent that the purpose of the process management will be the same, as in the company A, as both parallel and functional organizations have to exist to increase the efficiency of the operations and control over the departments. Moreover, implementation of process management principles is the most beneficial for the logistics companies, as with the introduction and development of technology it becomes a necessity in order to enhance a quality of operations (Palsaitis and Bazaras 14). Subsequently, for One Stop Logistics, process management will be beneficial and increase the effectiveness of the services. In this case, this logistic company should consider reorganization of its structure and conduct training for its workers, as it will help improve the flow of its operations and quality of the provided services. In conclusion, it could be said that the process management appears to be a necessity in the modern world, as the control over the processes becomes a requirement. However, some companies experience difficulties while implementing the primary principles of the process management, as it is hard to adapt rapidly to the modifications. Nonetheless, this trend has a growing popularity and can be considered beneficial for the companies, which are the parts of the bigger corporations. Lastly, it is apparent that this development has a positive impact on the logistics’ services enhancement, as in this case, it is an essentiality to provide a continuous flow of goods and services.

"Upstream investments refer to investments made in the earlier stages of the production process, while downstream investments refer to investments made in the later stages of the production process.In the context of a supply chain, upstream investments refer to investments made in the raw materials, resources, or technology needed to produce a product. For example, a company that manufactures cars may make an upstream investment by purchasing the raw materials needed to build the car, such as steel and rubber, or by investing in new machinery to increase production efficiency.Downstream investments, on the other hand, refer to investments made in the distribution, marketing, and sales of a product. For example, a company that manufactures cars may make a downstream investment by setting up a network of dealerships to sell the cars, or by investing in advertising to promote the brand.Upstream and downstream investments are important considerations for businesses because they can have a significant impact on the cost and efficiency of the production process, as well as the success of the product in the market.",1,ai

"""The most important thing is to be a safe driver on the road,"" Dr. Srinivasan said at a transportation meeting held in Brooklyn. ""This is a very important message for parents to drive safely and to use the phone in a safe manner at all times."" It is impossible to avoid the temptation when a child is in the back seat. One woman told one mother after a child had fallen from the car of a stranger she never knew: ""You'll need an ambulance any minute."" But, most parents agree, the number of children killed in accidents while riding in cars has dropped dramatically during the last two decades. In 1987, an average of 10.6 children died per year, including one from being ejected out of a moving car. That number dropped steadily over the next four decades, to 3.7 in 2011. Only three years in that period had fatalities exceed the number in 1987. The reason, most experts believe, is that drivers are more carefully watching for distracted driving. They also see children younger than seven playing with phones and other devices, in addition to texting and talking on the phone. But even at a time when the number of children in cars has dropped, the risk of getting one seriously hurt or killed while riding in one is still extremely high, experts said. The most recent studies are focused on children ages 2 to 9. Photo ""There are always things that you can do"" to be safe, said Robert H. Chacko, director of the pediatric neurology unit at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick, N.J., who specializes in treating children with motor neurons. He is co-chairman of the National Safety Council to Reduce Teen Vehicle Deaths, which has sponsored the conference. ""It all comes down to you being safe, not waiting for somebody else."" Some experts said parents need to be more demanding of their children's use of phones and other devices so they are not in a position to be distracted by the distraction. Some other parents say that, for instance, when their children are in their car, they make sure they take time before they leave the house and not leave their child sitting in the car alone and beep the horn to get their attention, said Laura T. O'Neill, a sociologist who has studied distracted driving and written a book on the subject. ""If that works when they are 10 or 12,"" she said, ""they may well lose the ability even to pay attention to them at those ages."" For children who have been on the road for several years, the task of driving on the road can be even more daunting. Some may not always have a parent or family member to take their children to the park and the bus stop; others may have had difficulty adjusting when they are away from the home, like a sudden change in school or after a long period of being homeschooled. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Some have become accustomed to driving alone, and if they are distracted by their phone during a stop, they may not notice they are not doing anything. Others have not been taught to listen carefully when they are behind the wheel, but may have learned to take shortcuts and drive on the highway, not the main road. Driving in a group of children is more of a challenge, but many are adept at riding in pairs. ""When they are getting older, the only way that they are going to learn to get through this is to be exposed to it as a reality,"" said Dr. Daren E. Balsalobre, a professor of pediatric neurology at Northwestern University in Chicago and a panel member at the conference. He added, ""The only way we are going to teach them is to go out in groups, get your heads and your shoulders washed clean."" For younger children, Dr. Srinivasan recommends that parents use a smartphone app from the maker of the phone and the smartphone to show them what they are doing when they are on the phone. The app, called ""Safe Kid,"" shows a live video stream of what the phone is doing if a phone is lost, stolen, broken or misused, so that parents know what they are doing.

"“Organizational Communication and Conflict Management” by Kenan Spaho Essay (Article) The article “Organizational Communication and Conflict Management” by Kenan Spaho explains the importance of internal and external communication in an organization. Lack of proper interaction or communication affects performance. The author goes further to explore the relevance of conflicts in an organization. During communications, people’s opinions tend to differ. The situation calls for new ideas to resolve such conflicts and have a common playing ground. Conflict management becomes a critical subject for managers. Managers should encourage teamwork, embrace dialogue, and make communication much better. According to Spaho (2013), conflicts are normal because employees will always differ. It is the duty of managers and supervisors to deal with all types of conflicts in their organizations. All managerial levels should use their experiences to address all the conflicts in an organization. Organizational managers have a role to play towards fostering better organizational strategy and conflict management practices (Spaho, 2013). The author goes further to explain why proper conflict management strategies will promote organizational effectiveness. Top-level managers are not the only ones to address such problems and disagreements. These managers are busy and might not tackle most of the conflicts. This might also result in negative influences. Article Critique The peer reviewed journal article identifies the issue of conflict as something that can affect the effectiveness of an organization. The author has acknowledged the presence of disagreements or conflicts in every organization. The important thing is to have proper measures to deal with such conflicts. Sometimes the problem becomes a major threat when there is no good external and internal communication at the organization. Poor communication will usually result in poor performance (Spaho, 2013). The author uses various examples to explain how managers can apply their competencies in order to address most of the issues affecting their organizations. The author also presents a clearly defined literature review. In this review, the author examines in details some forms of communication in an organization. This analysis makes it easier for the reader to understand some of the causes of disagreements in many organizations. As well, the article explores some of the major types of conflicts in a business organization. For example, vertical conflicts occur mainly when managers dictate their employees without letting them know what they should do. Horizontal conflicts are common when employees encounter challenges in their departments (Spaho, 2013). This information is necessary because it helps managers identify the conflicts in their organizations. The author identifies some other causes of misunderstandings such as limited resources, personal differences, poor communication, and lack of motivation among others. It is impossible to identify conflicts in any organization. The author supports this assertion using the major stages of organizational conflicts. That being the case, managers should have proper conflict management strategies. Managers should examine the communication strategy in the business and then focus on the best styles to manage his or her employees. Every managerial level should play a unique responsibility towards promoting the best communication processes. The approach helps managers deal with conflicts and promote organizational effectiveness. This article is relevant because it offers useful insights and ideas that can help many organizations deal with conflicts and ineffectiveness. Management is a critical process that calls for dedication, analysis, involvement, and motivation (Spaho, 2013). Personally, I believe this article is meaningful to the field of management or conflict management. Managers and supervisors will benefit significantly from the concepts and ideas explored in this article. Reference List Spaho, K. (2013). Organizational Communication and Conflict Management.

"(CNN) The United States has not had a president for eight years and, now in one year, the United States is headed to the polls to pick its next leader -- the second time in history. With all three major parties still in play, both the Republicans and Democrats are looking to the 2018 elections to set the agenda. In an effort to put a human face on their respective candidates, CNN is partnering with The Guardian's 2016 election team to profile some of the candidates vying to become the next American president. They are all running for the same office -- ""the highest public office in the land,"" as former US President Barack Obama so succinctly put it in his 2016 State of the Union address when he called for political action. Here's where each of the nine candidates stand on key issues: 1. Immigration JUST WATCHED Where is Trump on immigration? Replay More Videos . MUST WATCH Where is Trump on immigration? 01:51 US President Donald Trump, a Republican, was among the most vocal critics of the US immigration system since winning the election last November. He is vowing to deport undocumented immigrants who have been convicted of a major crime and are in the country illegally. His stance contrasts with the stance of Republican former President George W. Bush, who pushed Congress to pass the DREAM Act in 2006 -- a bill that would provide a pathway for young immigrants to obtain US citizenship. It was signed into law by Obama after then-US Attorney General Eric Holder said it would create ""a new path to citizenship for many of these young people."" 2.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is one of the more outspoken critics of what he calls gun-free zones, and he has made no secret of his desire to rein in the power of the National Rifle Association during the race. He tweeted after the Orlando nightclub massacre -- in which 49 people were killed last June -- that it was time to ""start legally discriminating against Muslims."" On Monday, he called for greater surveillance of Muslims in America. JUST WATCHED Does gun control have a chance? Replay More Videos . MUST WATCH Does gun control have a chance? 01:37 3. Climate change The rise of global warming is one of the hottest social debates of the day, and with the US president-elect calling climate change a hoax, there is a growing interest in finding a bipartisan approach on how to handle it. In an effort to bridge the partisan gap in the United States, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has called for a new, national dialogue on climate change as well as a plan for how to cope with its impacts in the years to come. Trump, for his part, has been accused of threatening an independent investigation into a Chinese-led climate change scheme , and of refusing to affirm that burning fossil fuels is causing global warming to occur.

Women's rights to abortions Clinton's stances on reproductive rights are more conservative than most Democratic politicians. She has called for expanding access to safe abortions, making emergency contraception available over the counter, and backing measures to raise the age of legal consent for abortion from 20. Trump, on the other hand, has vowed to push for a ban on abortion entirely, which would lead to a dramatic shift in abortion access nationwide.

"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil – Today, the Brazilian Senate rejected a proposal that would have made it more difficult for consumers to use bitcoins. Senators voted in favor of a non-binding resolution from MP Fernando Alves (PP-PDAE) that would have limited companies such as bitcoin exchange Bitstamp from providing services to Brazil, while simultaneously forcing Brazilian residents to use U.S. dollars. The proposal has been condemned by the Ministry of Finance, which is the body responsible for regulating financial transactions in the country. Bitcoin's Rise in Brazil According to the Minister of Finance, the country is among the most affected countries in the Bitcoin world due to its strong demand for the digital currency. With around $6 billion worth of bitcoins in circulation, the country is also a popular destination for investment money, with more than $10 billion in Bitcoin investments raised in just the last year. However, for financial companies that provide a similar service worldwide, it appears they can't rely on the Brazilian government to protect their assets from foreign governments. For Bitstamp, the loss of the Bitcoin business would have been a blow for two reasons. For one, the exchange lost several thousand customers due to the government's plans. Also, the U.S. dollar was already considered to be the preferred currency for Bitcoin trades throughout the country, which is where an estimated 65 percent of Bitstamp customers are from. The Senate has been a long-held opponent of regulation on Bitcoin, claiming that the digital currency is simply money laundering and a means to invest fraudulently. Brazil's anti-money laundering bureau, known as ANS, is considered the authority responsible for controlling bitcoin exchanges. Earlier this year, the Brazilian Senate sent out a warning to the financial industry about its involvement with Bitcoin. Image from Shutterstock. Advertisement",1,ai

"on, naturally they called on me for help. Of course, it was always too late for me to do anything about it. People figured that a battle between two equal forces would be a good one, but not many considered the fact that you couldn't really stop someone who was gone before you knew you needed to stop him. Regardless, everyone knew that eventually things would end with a showdown between me and the Time Villain. None of us ever guessed how it would really end for me. But now I know. I ’ m not sure how I know, but I do. For the past year or so I have felt one more day of life slip away from me each time I stopped the world for everyone else. I could feel that I only had a few left, and now I ’ m sure that my next stop will be my last. I feel it more clearly than anything I've felt before.

"Before is a place you don't really want to go. It's twice as treacherous as a There, where choices are mazes or labyrinths you have to navigate. Just imagine that. In There, each major choice is a maze or a labyrinth, but just to make a minor choice ( like whether to turn left or right) you have to traverse miniature mazes and labyrinths and -- well the choices stack up and as you can imagine, many people don't end up ever leaving There. But Before -- twice as dangerous. If many people don't end up leaving There, hardly any emerge from Before. Unfortunately, it's nearly impossible to get to the fabled lands of Elsewhere if you don't cross through the tricky terrain of Before. Recently, intrepid explorers took to the waters and sailed through the South Before Sea to get to Elsewhere, but out of the twenty-nine experienced mariners, only two survived. My brother sailed with the group. He wasn't one of those two. Not exciting odds. Nobody really knows much about Elsewhere, except that it's bordered by Nowhere, the Unknown, and Before ; Nowhere is impossible to enter, and nobody has ever made it to Unknown. Maybe one day someone will find the trick of getting Nowhere, but until then, Before ( or the South Before Sea) is the only way to get Elsewhere. But you, you don't have a choice, do you? The Here Guards are after you after that unseemly thing with that woman who died after going There -- and look, I'm not saying it's your fault, but you know how things are Here -- so you're going to have to buck up and travel to Before. Remember to bring a token of some sort, to remind yourself of what's real and what's present. People in Before tend to get lost in those sweet childhood memories, and all of those things that we love about our pasts. It's a huge escapist trap. It's brilliant. Well -- good luck. You'll find sanctuary in Elsewhere, I guess, but suspect that like everyone else, you'll get stuck in",0,human
"Prayer is an ancient tool of the Church, even if you haven't heard of it until recently. We have used it for a long time and it has been a tool of healing and peace, even as those we pray for have suffered and died; and so have those we seek to save. I offer you a prayer of protection. If you need prayer, or if you feel that you may in any way be at risk, you can join with this prayer, and all you need to do is to ask for divine help. You also can share this prayer with others as they find themselves in the midst of a crisis situation. You might feel safer that they know, too, when we pray of our protectors and the saints. If you share, please please let me know how this prayer has helped you in your life, and how it may do the same in theirs, for they are the protectors and we are the seekers, and for that we can all pray for each other. Hail Mary. Hail Virgin Mary. Hail the Lord. Hail the Holy Ghost. We ask this in the most Holy Name of Jesus Christ, Who was conceived and was born of the Father before all ages. Hail Mary, Mother of the Son of God, We believe that Our Lord is God in person. We believe that He is God the Son, as God the eternal Son. We also believe that, as God the Son, He took upon Himself the nature of man and became man. As God the Son, it was possible that He had been sinless and sinless, and so it was fitting that on the cross He shed His blood to satisfy the justice of God. On the cross He died for us, He suffered for us, and He rose again for us on the third day. In this life, Our Lord has become our Mediator and our Redeemer, and He is the one who is interceding with God for us. Though He is our Mediator, He is not our Savior and Redeemer. Though He is our Mediator, He is not our Lord and God. Though He is our Mediator, He is not our judge; and though He is our Mediator, He is not our Messiah either. Because He is our Mediator, He is a person of sin, born of a woman, and crucified and buried. We believe that He died so that, by dying on the cross, He became the first fruits of those who would be saved under the gospel of Jesus Christ. We believe that all those who, under the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, come to maturity in their faith and love and are baptized, receive the forgiveness of sins and the gift of eternal life with Christ. Although all are saved from the wrath of God, some are lost. By grace through faith, and by the Holy Spirit, all are redeemed from that state of sin and death which was in them from the fall of Adam, and are born of God in Christ Jesus. Through the Holy Spirit, through faith in Christ and through baptism, we ask that all people who desire to be saved may enter into a relationship with Jesus Christ and His Church. We pray that through the blood of Jesus our Lord and Savior, all are reconciled with each other and become heirs of God's family that He has made through the Spirit and the Word. We believe that Christ is the Savior of the world to the glory of God (Phil. 2:10) and for the salvation of the world. That is why he became man on earth to redeem all mankind (John 1:12) and to save them from all their sins. Our Savior has given us eternal life (John 3:16). His death on the cross gave eternal life to all who would be saved through Him (1 John 5:7). We believe that God loves and redeems all who have ever lived (Ps. 33:6). We believe He saved our first parents (Gen. 1:28). We believe He redeemed Adam and Eve, and our first ancestors from the Fall (Rom. 5:12; Col. 1:14). We also believe He has made us members of the body of Christ (Eph. 3:14). We believe that we have been elected by God to live in this world for a time, to become accountable to Him for what we do, and to be a light to those who have not seen our Savior. That is why every Christian should pray that the Lord will give them courage so that they may live a life consistent with His will (Phil. 1:9–13). We believe that, as we live this life in obedience to God's laws, we are saved (Acts 16:31). The gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ is the good news of salvation for all people, and this good news is not to be denied anyone (James 1:19",1,ai

"Sprint Nextel filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Friday, the second time they are facing bankruptcy. (Getty Images) (CNSNews.com) – A second federal bankruptcy court has rejected T-Mobile's (NYSE:TMUS) attempt to overturn a decision by a jury to award $9.17 billion to the U.K.'s Vodafone (VOD.L) over a data roaming dispute in 2011. Last year a jury awarded Vodafone a record $5 billion damages against T-Mobile USA. The second circuit court rejected this claim as a matter of law, according to documents filed late Thursday by Vodafone. The case began in 2012. An earlier jury awarded U.K.'s Vodafone $4.1 billion in 2013 on the second trial's damages. But Vodafone's lawyers appealed that decision, and on Friday a federal bankruptcy court in New York rejected it, according to a motion filed by the defendants. Vodafone has accused T-Mobile USA of ""flagrantly false"" statements about the nature of the deal that prevented Vodafone paying Vodafone the $5 billion award originally awarded the U.K. telecommunications company. Vodafone had alleged in the second trial that T-Mobile USA ""misrepresented"" that the data roaming agreement Vodafone had made with AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) was for two years only. Vodafone contended that T-Mobile USA's promise of unlimited data for two years was the deal the two companies reached in 2011. Vodafone said Friday that T-Mobile USA misrepresented to investors and the press that there had been a ""three year"" agreement for the same term of unlimited data that Vodafone had signed with AT&T in January 2009. Vodafone said that it has ""reasonably concluded,"" following ""a lengthy review,"" that the two agreements were indeed for two-year terms. ""Vodafone is not seeking to enforce its contractual right to payment of Vodafone's contractual obligations,"" the company said in the filing, adding that the two-year agreement ""was made for the purpose of achieving the agreement with AT&T."" ""It was not used as an inducement or an alternative, or to further T-Mobile's business interests,"" the company said. Vodafone had asserted that a ""fraud"" was in Playpen, where child pornography was stored, in order of how ""vital"" the data was. In its filing, Vodafone claimed that T-Mobile USA lied about the reason it could not pay for the data. Vodafone alleged that T-Mobile USA told investors that it would be unable to pay for Playpen access if it ""received a significant additional payment from another supplier of Vodafone."" Because that customer was AT&T, they said, T-Mobile USA ""undertook the process of acquiring the rights to make a significant payment from the other supplier and attempting to force that supplier to pay, without the court's approval,"" and ""Vodafone was forced to pay the $1.2 billion in additional charges."" T-Mobile USA ""undertook the process of acquiring the rights to make a significant payment from another supplier to force T-Mobile USA to pay [$1.2 billion] in additional charges"" and Vodafone ""was forced to pay $1.2 billion in additional charges"" despite the possibility that Vodafone would not be able to pay any such charges in the first place, the company said. ""However,"" Vodafone added, there ""was no obligation to negotiate with Vodafone regarding its $1.2 billion in additional charges."" T-Mobile USA ""never attempted to force Google to pay [$900 million],"" the company said. ""The same Google was being forced to pay $900 million by T-Mobile USA, without court approval."" T-Mobile USA also refused an offer by T-Mobile USA, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)] and Sprint Corp. (NYSE:S), which were the other competitors at the Vodafone deal, to settle for approximately $5 billion. ""Rather,"" the carrier said in a filing of its own, ""T-Mobile USA never attempted to make any substantive arrangements to deliver or provide any data services."" T-Mobile USA also contended that it had ""reasonably concluded"" that if Vodafone accepted its claim for payment over Google, it would also agree to the terms for Vodafone's offer for Playpen data access, which Vodafone now says it could not. T-Mobile USA told the court it has no reason to believe that Google agreed to",1,ai
"It was the Packers vs. the Broncos. Superbowl LXXIX ( 79). It was the fourth quarter. 1:01 left on the clock with the Packers down by 6 on the final drive. Johnny Carrington was the Packers' QB.

If he completed one more touchdown pass, he would be the ``winningest'' QB in NFL history. Johnny stands in shotgun formation. He gets the snap, looks left - his WR is covered ; looks right - double coverage.

"As the first episode of The Flash goes to air on CBS Monday night, DC fans who have been eagerly anticipating the premiere will get some answers. The show, the much-anticipated continuation of the DC Universe, has been off the air for a year, and we all know that means we're all waiting, patiently, for the return of Barry Allen and Team Flash. Fortunately, the first trailer for the show was released online back in December, and as an episode about to air on television, we were able to check it out. The official synopsis for episode 1, ""Out Of Time"", is as follows: The battle for the future has begun, but it's not just the forces of good and evil fighting over the fate of the world: It's also the people. As the first episode of The Flash returns to TV on Monday, February 17, fans can now learn more about the show's heroes and villains as Barry Allen (Grant Gustin) begins his fight to become the fastest man alive. ""Out of Time"" is the first episode featuring the mysterious Reverse-Flash (Tom Cavanagh) and a battle for the future of the future. The Reverse-Flash's arrival forces Team Flash into a new kind of fight: The battle for the future. ""We're exploring the future, and it's very exciting for comic book fans,"" executive producer Andrew Kreisberg says. ""The Flash has always been about that notion, and that means it's going to be awesome."" While some of our members from the DC comics community (myself included) will be happy to hear this, many more will likely be disappointed – given that, even though it's a trailer, much of it is still unseen. And, while the trailer didn't give away all too much, I'll certainly be spending the next few weeks poring over every last frame to figure out if I missed anything.

"all. Everything went still then, the first time for the day. A blur filled my vision, focusing only on a coin floating in mid air.

Everything resumed, and the handsome man stared at me. “ I… Is everything set for tonight? ” I asked him. “ Yes, sir, ” he said. I had lost the courage. The coin of God had taken him away from me.

"In an exclusive interview with Yahoo, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) says the Republican Party must embrace immigration reform, including securing the border and passing legislation to reform the H-1B program. ""This is a real crisis,"" he says. ""This is a time to act"" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) spoke to Yahoo News Daily about the H-1B visa program, the border crisis and how to resolve the immigration debate. What you are saying is that in order to reform the H-1B program the Republican Party is going to have to take it up on their own. No. The Republican Party understands the threat that the H-1B is and that this needs to be addressed. This was the case before this executive order. And the Republicans made some very significant reforms to the H-1B process. So why would I say that we should not do anything at this point on immigration? Why would we put out a piece of legislation on immigration that is in a way going to gut immigration enforcement, including securing the border? I believe we have to go down a different path. One that is designed to secure the border. One that treats the H-1B program as something that actually brings the best talent into the country. And actually makes the American people much more prosperous. And the H-1B would go in the same category that the H-2B program is in right now, in which only an extremely small amount of employment is done.",1,ai
"Chennai: India is not ready to accept the Rohingya Muslims, who have been fleeing violence in Western Myanmar's Rakhine state for decades, a senior Indian diplomat said on Tuesday, suggesting the international community might have to act to ensure the migrants get the necessary protection. It was ""clear and understandable"" that some are escaping violence in Myanmar's Rakhine state for Pakistan and Afghanistan, but ""we are not ready to accept them,"" Indian Ambassador Syed Akbaruddin told PTI. ""We cannot keep taking them from one point (in Rakhine state) and sheltering them at another point. ""To take them all the way to India would be impossible, so we have taken them from one side and we are sheltering them at the other side,"" Akbaruddin said. ""We would definitely help (the Rohingyas) but I just am not at the stage that we can say there is a need to do something else. ""You know the Rohingya problem that has faced the international community and all other governments for some time,"" he said. In recent years, millions of Rohingya have fled Myanmar, which has described them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. The United Nations has described the exodus as a ""textbook example of racial incitement and ethnic cleansing"". About 800,000 Rohingya have fled the violence into neighboring Bangladesh through the Bay of Bengal. On Monday, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on Tuesday appealed for the release of all those still in dire need of international protection. In its annual report it says India has taken in more ""asylum seekers"" than any other country except for Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. The report says India has accepted 9,923 asylum seekers between January and 31 December 2016 ""from countries of origin in the Middle East and Africa"". It had taken in over 17,000 people in the first 11 months of the current financial year, up from 15,894 in the same period last year. The UNHCR has been requesting a ""complete suspension of the processing of asylum claims"" by Indian nationals seeking international protection. In the recent past, India has turned back hundreds of illegal Bangladeshi boats which were intercepted off the country's southern tip. Earlier this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government announced an ambitious programme to resettle 25,000 refugees from the region within 100 days by allowing them to settle in a ""home like environment"" within 10 days after receiving protection. On Tuesday, Akbaruddin said that his government has also launched a study to understand the role that international and local development partners play in the lives of the Rohingya. A group of international development partners had in the last three years funded $200 million of construction and infrastructure projects for the Rohingya in Rakhine state which they say improved welfare. ""The report will be compiled, not based on what the UNHCR says,"" Akbaruddin said, adding that while some Indian government departments like Defence are studying the UN agency's report, the government would ""take that to heart"".

"I've never been a fan of the idea of ""safe spaces""—whereby one must not ask difficult questions or bring up sensitive subjects—but last night's HBO show The Deuce (2015) is such a show that it is hard not to get swept up in it. At the very least, it is worth watching if you have not seen it yet and wish to understand why this HBO show, which was inspired by true events, seemed so appealing to so many. The Deuce is currently playing in New York City, but was adapted by David Simon's ""Treme"" on HBO. It centers around the prostitution business in the 1980s (in the 1990s, prostitution is legal. A man calls a female friend, ""the ex-wife of a major drug dealer""), and follows the sleazy (some say corrupt) lives of a small group of women, including sex workers, women who live out the lives of their sex lives with men, and the wives of men in and of themselves. It's about a lot of things, but it is certainly not a love story. There are also sex scenes and drug transactions, but to understand this show, one has to understand the business, sex work, and the women who exist in the world of prostitution. Last night, I spoke with showrunner Michael Silverman (who wrote the book on which the series is based) about his work as a sex worker, the meaning of ""Deuces,"" and his thoughts on the way we talk about and discuss sexuality in our culture. In between, he shared his deep understanding of the complex lives of prostitutes, the show's dark sex scenes, and its portrayal of the lives and relationships of the women it depicts, many of whom are now in their 50s and older. It's nice to finally have a show that puts prostitutes on the mainstream radar again. What were some of the things you wanted to get out of that? Oh, a lot of it. [laughs] All the sex scenes, I wanted the sex scenes to be really intense, because that's what we usually do when we talk about sex in the real world. Most conversations about the sex industry focus on, ""Well, what's the best sex position?"" or ""What are sex toys like?"" or, ""What does the client look like?"" But we actually want to show what real sex is like, in all its complexity. It's not just, like, people getting frisky in the back of a car because they're bored. There are also psychological dynamics to consider, and the clients don't always want to be paying for the sex—they want to be paying for the relationship. People in prostitution are often people who have suffered abuse, who were sexually abused as children, and who then are thrown into a world that looks the same, has the same rules, and they're unable to adapt to it, and they end up having to take care of others. That's why it's difficult for me to write about the women from the show. I can't really understand them—their experiences are very difficult for me to relate to. It can be really frustrating to write about women who are so incredibly damaged. The more complex these women become, the more it feels like they're being used—as sexual objects. [laughs] Yes. And because it's about women, people assume that the prostitution business is women's business, but it's not women's business. The entire business is run by women, and the people in it are not men—they're not just customers in that way. It's a world where women are treated as sexual objects, and the men who work in that business are treated as the commodities. They're not workers, they're not employees, they're not employees under contracts—they're not even employees working under a roof. They're treated, on a day-to-day basis, as commodities. So they're treated in ways that are fundamentally different from men who are dealing with the same business. People who write about prostitution don't necessarily have much insight into the women. They tend to write about the men—in particular, the drug dealers who are often described as ""babeizers."" How do you make a show and write about women if you don't understand the people with whom you're dealing? The women are the most intriguing element. They're incredibly complicated people. There is a sort of innocence—they're all so innocent—but they're also incredibly complicated. I can't really be more sensitive with respect to the sex scenes than with, say, a drug addict. Sex scenes are all about intimacy—how intimate can one person be with another person? Not having sex with someone isn't just awkward—it's also scary. The women are not just women who're getting it on with men. I was amazed at the complexity of the scene where one of the prostitutes has sex with a man. How do you even get a woman to do that? I mean",1,ai

"The video of the officer who shot Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, has gone viral. Here are some of the most striking images. Ferguson, Missouri, officer Darren Wilson has been in the news for a whole lot more than his confrontation with a black teenager. The officer has been the subject of intense scrutiny and criticism. A group calling itself F.B.I. Agents of Repression was created to ""promote the organization,"" according to a statement from the group's spokesman, who has gone by the name of ""Lance Wallnau."" As of Wednesday, ""Lance"" posted on the group's Facebook page, ""We've collected 100,000 views, over a 100 people have commented, and every week we are getting several new members."" According to Wallnau, they're a ""non-partisan grassroots group,"" but the organization's website makes clear its purpose's are to ""protest America's racist police forces."" Its Facebook page has over 6,000 likes, and its Twitter account has nearly 1,000 followers. One image that's become particularly popular on social media is of a man, allegedly Wilson, pointing his gun at a crying infant, who was apparently a threat to public safety. ""Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson shot and killed this baby while he was 5 months old,"" reads the caption, on a picture captured by a bystander of an ambulance transporting the infant. The photograph has been shared over 1,500 times on Facebook. Advertisement Wilson has not been apprehended, and the shooting apparently occurred around 2:30 pm local time. Police said the officer and the baby went out for a walk on Tuesday afternoon, then walked back home together at around 2:30. The Ferguson Police Department was widely criticized after they released video footage of Wilson shooting Brown at least six times, leaving the man dead in the middle of a street. But an officer has not yet been arrested for the shooting.",1,ai
"A A SEATTLE - The University of Washington, with a $350 million endowment, might seem the ideal destination for a private equity firm. But University of Hawaii President David Lassner told KIRO's Dori Monson that there may be more room for one in Hilo. ""I'm not exactly sure what the future holds,"" Lassner said. Hawaii is a place of endless possibilities and challenges. Many companies that seek to do good and make money don't choose the islands, or have them as an option. Some see Hawaii as a place to develop products and services, while others are drawn to its lush islands and natural wonders. The idea of a private equity firm taking an interest in a university would be a far cry from that first idea. This is because a major reason private equity firms typically choose an existing company - rather than a startup with no revenue history - is because the firm has a history of success selling its products. Lassner said that is not the case with UW, which is not a company that's made a lot of money. ""It's not exactly a place that's been built for private equity, certainly not a company that's made money, and not one that's made a lot of money,"" Lassner said. So the university has had to think about different ways to attract attention, including the University of Washington Research and Technology Park, a 2.6 square mile property being developed by the state of Hawaii. ""These are the kinds of things for which we have access to resources,"" Lassner said. ""We have this huge infrastructure that is available to us, whether it's university offices, whether it's public space, whether it's land."" The university is also in talks with the University of Washington about building a new research and development building on its main campus in Seattle - something which seems like a natural fit for private equity. ""They're very much like 'why have you not been able to put your research into practice?' So we've been working with them for the last nine years,"" Lassner said. But if anything, Lassner sees the possibility of U.W. providing expertise that private equity firms need, in fields that are not generally associated with public institutions. ""You'd be working with public universities in the U.S.,"" Lassner said. ""If you start in research, you know, in the public sector, you begin to understand those institutions and you know where you can fit in."" He said he thinks there may even be some interesting private equity opportunities that could come from the UW Research and Technology Park. Even without a private equity firm, the UW still has plenty of money. The university says there are several ways it can use that money to improve the lives of the people who attend its schools. The university said it could work with the city of Seattle and its businesses, and the City of Hilo to improve transportation and create a new parking garage to serve the university.",1,ai
"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ""Femme fatale"" redirects here. For other uses, see Femme fatale (disambiguation) ""Femme fatale"" is a popular genre of short stories from the nineteenth century that involves the character who seduces and eventually kills her lover as his family watches. The term ""femme fatale"" can also be used as a shortened form of ""femme fatale"", referring to the traditional woman or to the traditional woman's role as the seductress. The term and concept were popular and influential during the Victorian era, and a popular short story titled ""The Haunting of Hester Prynne"" by Thomas Browne was published in 1820. Most early stories were written by authors who lived during the Victorian era. Examples [ edit ] Other literature [ edit ] Other works by and about the genre include See also [ edit ]",1,ai
"Mongolia, with the lowest population density of any country in the world—about 2 people per square kilometer—would appear an unlikely birthplace for the largest contiguous empire in the history of the world. Today's inhabitants (which number fewer than three million in a country the size of California, Texas, Montana and West Virginia combined) are largely dependent on livestock production for their livelihoods. Much of the population practices a form of nomadic pastoralism in which herders follow their animals. Related Content Medieval Cone Shaped Princess Hats Were Inspired by Mongol Warrior Women But in the early 1200s, Genghis Khan united the Mongol tribes and began invading neighbors in all directions. The Mongol Empire continued to grow after his death, led by the mighty leader's sons and grandsons, who pushed their armies into regions as far as eastern Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Korea. This great empire was made possible not by brilliant leadership alone, but by a 15-year period of abnormal moisture and warmth in central Mongolia in the early 1200s, according to Neil Pederson of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and colleagues, who report their findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. A brief change in the local climate, they say, was key in the rise of the Mongols. The research team was able to reconstruct the climate of central Mongolia from tree rings—relying on how the width of the concentric circles changes annually and reflects the yearly trend in temperature and moisture. Two of the researchers had discovered a stand of ancient Siberian pines growing out of the cracks in an old lava field in the Khangai Mountains of Central Mongolia. They took cross-sections of dead trees and cores of living ones. They calibrated the width of the rings with instrumental climate data collected from 1959 to 2009 and created a key that let them determine weather going back 1,112 years. The tree rings reflected several global-scale climate events, such as the Little Ice Age and the beginning of the Anthropocene. But the researchers could also see important local climatic changes. From 1180 to 1190, Central Mongolia experienced an intense drought that probably contributed to the political instability of that time. Established patterns of leadership were disrupted, and the region saw continuous warfare. ""The worsening dry conditions…would have been an important contributing factor in the collapse of the established order and emergence of a centralized leadership under [Genghis] Khan,"" the researchers write. In 1211, Central Mongolia then entered its most unusual period in the millennium-long record: a 15-year stretch that was warm and, more importantly, incredibly wet. Those conditions would have provided a surplus of grass for both the horses for the Mongol army—each trooper would bring three to five horses so that he always had a fresh ride—and the livestock that followed the army to keep the warriors fed. Without an increase in productivity, the pastoralism practiced in this region of the world would not have provided enough surplus resources for such efforts. All the resources available would have had to be devoted to keeping people alive, as they largely are now. Genghis Khan may have been a great leader, but without the warm, wet years to give the region a boost, he wouldn't have had the resources for building a strong government and large army. The world may have been a very different place. The Mongol Empire split into four smaller empires in 1260, and each of these continued to expand into the 14th century, eventually failing due to internal disputes. The legacy of the great empire, however, lives on, perhaps most notably in human DNA: Sixteen million men across the former Mongol Empire share an identical Y chromosome, the likely legacy of a former pillager, perhaps the Great Khan himself. The current occupants of Mongolia, though, are now dealing with a period of much harsher climate than what was experienced in the early 1200s. The region suffered a drought from 2002 to 2009, which, the tree rings reveal, was as bad in length and lack of precipitation as what was seen in the 1180s and hotter than anything in the 1,112-year record. A new invasion has taken place, but one far different than what Genghis Khan led: People from rural areas are flooding into Mongolia's capital, Ulaanbaatar. Unusually cold and long winter of 2009 to 2010 killed at least 8 million animals, about 17 percent of the nation's herd. Many herders lost their livelihoods and nearly half a million migrated to Ulaanbaatar in search of jobs. Weather, it seems, can make invaders of us in one way or another.",0,human
"Abstract Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a major cause of hospital-acquired infections that are becoming increasingly difficult to combat because of emerging resistance to all current antibiotic classes. The evolutionary origins of MRSA are poorly understood, no rational nomenclature exists, and there is no consensus on the number of major MRSA clones or the relatedness of clones described from different countries. We resolve all of these issues and provide a more thorough and precise analysis of the evolution of MRSA clones than has previously been possible. Using multilocus sequence typing and an algorithm, burst, we analyzed an international collection of 912 MRSA and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates. We identified 11 major MRSA clones within five groups of related genotypes. The putative ancestral genotype of each group and the most parsimonious patterns of descent of isolates from each ancestor were inferred by using burst, which, together with analysis of the methicillin resistance genes, established the likely evolutionary origins of each major MRSA clone, the genotype of the original MRSA clone and its MSSA progenitor, and the extent of acquisition and horizontal movement of the methicillin resistance genes. Major MRSA clones have arisen repeatedly from successful epidemic MSSA strains, and isolates with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin, the antibiotic of last resort, are arising from some of these major MRSA clones, highlighting a depressing progression of increasing drug resistance within a small number of ecologically successful S. aureus genotypes. Methicillin was introduced in 1959 to treat infections caused by penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. In 1961 there were reports from the United Kingdom of S. aureus isolates that had acquired resistance to methicillin (methicillin-resistant S. aureus, MRSA) (1), and MRSA isolates were soon recovered from other European countries, and later from Japan, Australia, and the United States. MRSA is now a problem in hospitals worldwide and is increasingly recovered from nursing homes and the community (2, 3). The methicillin resistance gene (mecA) encodes a methicillin-resistant penicillin-binding protein that is not present in susceptible strains and is believed to have been acquired from a distantly related species (4). mecA is carried on a mobile genetic element, the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec), of which four forms have been described that differ in size and genetic composition (5). Many MRSA isolates are multiply resistant and are susceptible only to glycopeptide antibiotics such as vancomycin and investigational drugs. MRSA isolates that have decreased susceptibility to glycopeptides (glycopeptide intermediately susceptible S. aureus, GISA) (6, 7), reported in recent years, are a cause of great public health concern. Many studies have characterized MRSA isolates from individual hospitals or countries and have identified strains that appear to be well adapted to the hospital environment, are established in several hospitals within a country, or have spread internationally (epidemic MRSA, EMRSA). MRSA isolates are generally characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, a powerful technique for identifying the relatedness of isolates from recent outbreaks within a hospital, but are not well suited to long-term global epidemiology, which requires a procedure that is highly discriminatory but that indexes variation that accumulates slowly. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) provides such a procedure and characterizes isolates of bacteria unambiguously by using the sequences of internal fragments of seven housekeeping genes (8, 9). MLST has been developed and validated for S. aureus (10) and provides a discriminatory method that allows related strains recovered in different countries to be readily identified. The origins of the major MRSA clones are still poorly understood. Kreiswirth et al. (11) proposed that all MRSAs were descended from a single ancestral S. aureus strain that acquired mecA, but more recent studies (12, 13) show that some MRSAs are very divergent, implying that mecA has been transferred between S. aureus lineages. The data from MLST can be used to probe the evolutionary and population biology of bacterial pathogens and to predict ancestral genotypes and patterns of evolutionary descent within groups of related genotypes. We have applied MLST to an international collection of 359 MRSA isolates, which includes examples of the previously described EMRSA and GISA clones, and compare these to a collection of 553 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSAs). We demonstrate the limited number of major EMRSA genotypes and provide an unambiguous method for characterizing MRSA and GISA clones and a rational",0,human
